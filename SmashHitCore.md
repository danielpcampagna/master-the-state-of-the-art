## [Abstract]([The smashHitCore Ontology](https://smashhiteu.github.io/smashHitCore/#abstract)


The adoption of GDPR has resulted in a significant shift in how the data of European Union citizens is handled. A variety of data sharing challenges in scenarios such as smart cities have arised, especially, when attempting to semantically represent GDPR legal basis, such as consent, contracts and the data types and specific data sources related to them. Many ontologies that model GDPR exist, however, they focus mainly on consent. In order to represent other GDPR basis such as contracts, multiple ontologies need to be reused. The process is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge of semantics. To solve this challenge, we present the smashHitCore ontology, which provides a unified and coherent model for both consent and contracts, as well as the sensor data and data processing associated with them, in one place. The ontology was developed in response to real-world data sharing use cases in the insurance and smart cities domains.

## Comparison against GDPRov and the 33 remaining Compliance Questions

To answer the 33 Compliance Questions (CQs) related to GDPR, integrating the **SmashHitCore ontology** with the existing **GDPRov ontology** could enhance its ability to cover operational and contractual aspects in data processing and management. Below are some elements from SmashHitCore that could prove useful for GDPRov’s extension.

By integrating these SmashHitCore elements, GDPRov can be extended to address broader operational concerns, including smart cities, contractual relationships, and data resource management, while ensuring full compliance with GDPR’s detailed requirements for data processing, retention, and third-party agreements.

| #   | SmashHitCore Term                                                  | Why it ranks in the Top 10                                                                                                                                           | Use-Case                                                                                                                                                                                              | Why is it necessary for GDPRov?                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1   | `smashHitCore:hasRetentionDate` (property)                         | Explicitly encodes the _end-of-life_ date of a data item—essential for demonstrating storage-limitation and retention discipline.                                    | A "CustomerInvoice" entity carries `hasRetentionDate "2028-12-31"^^xsd:date`; an automated report shows which invoices must be purged each month (CQ08, CQ29, CQ30, CQ51).                            | GDPRov can describe _processes_ that delete data, but cannot presently annotate _entities_ with concrete retention parameters—preventing machine-testable answers to CQs on duration. |
| 2   | `smashHitCore:StorageLocation` (class)                             | Distinguishes physical/cloud repositories where data reside, enabling mapping of cross-border flows and restoration capabilities.                                    | Linking a `gdprov:DataRepository` instance to `StorageLocation EU-West-1` lets auditors list all EU exports and prove incident-recovery paths (CQ63–65).                                              | GDPRov lacks a normative concept for geographic or logical storage loci, so it cannot relate provenance traces to transfer legality or disaster-recovery evidence.                    |
| 3   | `fibo-agr-ctr:Contract` (imported into SmashHitCore)               | Provides a rich contractual construct with effective/execution dates and parties—critical for controller–processor agreements.                                       | A `Contract #ACME-AWS` linked to processing activities documents SCC clauses and renewal dates (CQ39, CQ64).                                                                                          | GDPRov models _consent_ but has no vocabulary for _contracts_; without this it cannot evidence Article 28 processor agreements referenced in CQ39.                                    |
| 4   | `smashHitCore:DataController` (class)                              | Captures the legal role that determines purposes and means of processing; many CQs address controller duties.                                                        | Tagging `gdprov:Agent ex:Hospital` as `DataController` lets queries isolate controller-specific obligations for SAR turnaround (CQ17) and DPO appointment (CQ40).                                     | GDPRov treats agents generically; adding an explicit controller class resolves role ambiguity required to demonstrate compliance responsibilities across agents.                      |
| 5   | `smashHitCore:DataProcessor` (class)                               | Identifies processors subject to annexed contractual clauses and breach-notification chains.                                                                         | `DataProcessor ex:CloudProvider` linked to `Contract #ACME-AWS` supports automated checks that processors follow encryption duties (CQ50) and breach reporting (CQ58).                                | GDPRov has no role taxonomy beyond PROV-O’s `prov:Agent`, so it cannot separate controller vs. processor evidence demanded in multiple CQs.                                           |
| 6   | `smashHitCore:DataProtectionOfficer` (class)                       | Specifies a person/office accountable for GDPR governance, escalation, and public contact points.                                                                    | A `DataProtectionOfficer ex:DPO_JaneDoe` linked via `smashHitCore:hasDataProtectionOfficer` to the organisation enables verification of publication and supervisory-authority notification (CQ40-44). | GDPRov presently records _activities_ but not organisational governance structures, leaving CQs on DPO appointment and contact unmet.                                                 |
| 7   | `dpv:Security` (class)                                             | Abstract anchor for cataloguing technical, organisational, and physical safeguards that underpin Articles 32–34.                                                     | Associating a `gdprov:Process EncryptionAtRest` with `dpv:Security` provides evidence for encryption checks (CQ47, CQ50) and breach readiness (CQ57).                                                 | GDPRov logs that _an_ activity occurred, but cannot classify it as a security safeguard; thus it cannot answer whether documented security programmes exist.                          |
| 8   | `dpv:AccessControl` (class, isa `dpv:Security`)                    | Represents a specific safeguard family—vital for "halt processing" or role-based restriction procedures.                                                             | Binding the workflow step _"Suspend Account"_ to `dpv:AccessControl` proves capability to restrict processing on demand (CQ20, CQ21, CQ52).                                                           | GDPRov lacks a fine-grained taxonomy of security controls, making SAR stoppage or objection handling unverifiable in provenance traces.                                               |
| 9   | `dpv:Risk` (class)                                                 | Allows annotation of processing or security measures with assessed risk levels, supporting continual reviews.                                                        | Each process instance carries a `hasRisk dpv:Medium` triple; automated audits flag high-risk areas for six-monthly review (CQ56).                                                                     | GDPRov can show that reviews happened but cannot semantically link them to risk levels; adding `dpv:Risk` fills this analytical gap.                                                  |
| 10  | `dpv:Restrict` (class, purpose category)                           | Models the GDPR right to _restriction of processing_ and its procedural invocation.                                                                                  | When a data subject triggers Article 18, a provenance trace includes purpose `dpv:Restrict`; compliance dashboards verify existence of halting routines (CQ20, CQ25).                                 | GDPRov records activities but not the normative _purpose_ "restriction"; integrating this class provides the semantic handle to prove lawful suspension of operations.                |
| 11  | `smashHitCore:hasConsentStatus`                                    | Enables tracking the status of consent (e.g., granted, withdrawn, revoked) over time.                                                                                | To verify whether consent is still valid before processing data (e.g., CQ11, CQ51).                                                                                                                   | GDPRov lacks explicit modeling of consent state transitions, crucial for auditing revocations or expirations.                                                                         |
| 12  | `smashHitCore:GrantedAtTime` / `WithdrawnAtTime` / `RevokedAtTime` | Capture the lifecycle timestamps of a consent event.                                                                                                                 | Used to demonstrate whether data was processed during a valid consent window (e.g., CQ09, CQ51).                                                                                                      | GDPRov does not record time-qualified consent changes needed to track retention windows and lawful processing periods.                                                                |
| 13  | `smashHitCore:hasDataProtectionOfficer`                            | Connects systems with DPO contact and accountability structures.                                                                                                     | Answering CQ40–CQ44 regarding DPO designation, contact publication, and escalation lines.                                                                                                             | GDPRov has no built-in way to model DPO roles or their procedural relationships.                                                                                                      |
| 14  | `smashHitCore:hasDataController` / `hasDataProcessor`              | Defines organizational responsibilities in processing operations.                                                                                                    | Used in documenting data flow accountability (e.g., CQ39, CQ58, CQ63).                                                                                                                                | GDPRov mentions agents but does not distinguish controller/processor roles as formally required under GDPR.                                                                           |
| 15  | `smashHitCore:hasContactPoint`                                     | Points users to communication channels for rights requests or DPO contact.                                                                                           | Facilitates SARs and GDPR rights access points (e.g., CQ17, CQ33, CQ38).                                                                                                                              | GDPRov does not model how individuals can reach the organization or DPO.                                                                                                              |
| 16  | `smashHitCore:forPurpose`                                          | Semantically links a data processing activity to its declared purpose.                                                                                               | Required to justify data retention and lawful basis of processing (e.g., CQ08, CQ29).                                                                                                                 | GDPRov lacks a standardized vocabulary to tag purposes consistently with DPV or domain-specific extensions.                                                                           |
| 17  | `smashHitCore:hasContractStatus` / `hasContractType`               | Defines the status/type of contracts that might mandate processing or retention.                                                                                     | Justify retention under legal obligations (e.g., CQ30, CQ64).                                                                                                                                         | GDPRov does not model contract metadata, which can be essential for interpreting legitimate interest or legal obligations.                                                            |
| 18  | `smashHitCore:hasContext`                                          | Attaches contextual metadata to processing events.                                                                                                                   | E.g., differentiate between CCTV monitoring vs. data analytics in smart cities (CQ37).                                                                                                                | GDPRov models activities, but lacks a concept of `context` needed for compliance conditions that vary by situation.                                                                   |
| 19  | `smashHitCore:hasTrace`                                            | Links entities or activities to provenance traces or audit trails.                                                                                                   | Used for incident resolution, breach logs, and SAR response tracking (e.g., CQ17, CQ47, CQ57).                                                                                                        | GDPRov includes provenance semantics, but lacks an abstract link like `hasTrace` for reusable, inspectable logs.                                                                      |

## Integration

A compelling use-case for deploying **both GDPRov and SmashHitCore** arises in a _smart-city telematics insurance platform_ that collects vehicle sensor data, shares it with multiple parties (insurers, municipal traffic authorities, road-maintenance contractors), and must demonstrate end-to-end GDPR compliance while enforcing complex contractual conditions.

|Component of the scenario|Why SmashHitCore is needed|Why GDPRov is needed|
|---|---|---|
|**Sensor data streams** (speed, braking events, GPS)|`smashHitCore:SensorData`, `smashHitCore:BuildingData`, and DPV categories let the platform type each dataset, express its granularity, and relate it to contractual “data products.”|Provenance traces (`gdprov:DataCollectionProcess` → `gdprov:DataUseProcess`) record who captured each sample, under which consent, and how it was later anonymised or deleted.|
|**Usage-based-insurance contracts** between drivers and insurers|FIBO/contract classes embedded in SmashHitCore encode policy terms (premium algorithm, coverage period, retention clauses), enabling automated checks that data handling stays within contractual limits.|PROV-derived execution records show that premium calculations actually used the authorised data and respected the agreed retention period.|
|**Cross-border transfers** to cloud analytics in several EU regions|SmashHitCore’s `StorageLocation` and `Transfer` roles capture the legal basis (SCCs, adequacy decisions) and recipients.|GDPRov provenance shows the concrete transfer activities and links them to the underlying consent or legitimate-interest assessment, satisfying Articles 44–46 evidence.|
|**Data-subject rights workflow** (SAR, objection, restriction)|SmashHitCore’s role taxonomy (`DataController`, `DataProcessor`, `DataProtectionOfficer`) locates the accountable actors and their escalation paths.|GDPRov models the actual right-exercise events (`gdprov:HandleSARProcess`) and the data lineage proving that processing was halted, corrected, or erased.|
|**Security & audit dashboards**|DPV security classes in SmashHitCore supply a normalised vocabulary for encryption, access control, and risk ratings across the ecosystem.|GDPRov logs when each safeguard ran (e.g., daily backup, quarterly penetration test), enabling auditors to correlate controls with real incidents.|

**Why the combination adds value**

_SmashHitCore_ delivers rich **domain semantics** for contractual obligations, sensor-data types, storage loci, and actor roles, making it ideal for modelling what _should_ happen under insurance policies and data-sharing agreements. _GDPRov_, by contrast, excels at recording **fine-grained provenance**—what _did_ happen to each personal-data item throughout its life cycle—so that regulators can verify compliance with GDPR principles such as purpose limitation, storage limitation, and accountability.

When fused, the ontologies provide:

1. **Normative context + factual trace** – contractual terms and privacy policies (SmashHitCore) linked to concrete executions (GDPRov).
    
2. **Automated compliance analytics** – SPARQL or SHACL rules can flag deviations where provenance shows a use of data outside the contractual scope.
    
3. **Holistic evidence for regulators** – a single knowledge graph answers both business-level questions (“Was the data used only for agreed pricing models?”) and legal questions (“Can we prove timely deletion and SAR fulfilment?”).
    

Thus, any multi-party data-sharing ecosystem that mixes IoT sensor streams, contractual pricing models, and strict GDPR obligations stands to benefit markedly from employing **SmashHitCore for the contractual and domain layer and GDPRov for the provenance and compliance-trace layer**.
