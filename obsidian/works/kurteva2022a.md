due: The paper presents a semantic framework for representing consent using knowledge graphs. It introduces GConsent, a GDPR-compliant ontology that models consent states, assessment questions, and legal compliance requirements. The approach enhances transparency and auditability of consent-based data processing, making it highly relevant for GDPR-related compliance questions.

## **Evaluation Against Inclusion Criteria**

1. **Does the paper propose a data provenance model to represent activities related to GDPR obligations?**  
   - ✅ Yes. The paper **introduces the GConsent ontology**, an OWL-based semantic model that represents **informed consent under GDPR**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
   - It defines **various consent states (e.g., given, withdrawn, refused)** and maps **compliance assessment competency questions**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

2. **Is the proposed model useful to address the compliance questions?**  
   - ✅ Yes. The framework **enables automated compliance verification** and **legal compliance reasoning** using **ontology-based reasoning**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
   - The paper also **explores visualization techniques** to improve **user understanding of consent implications**.  

3. **Is the proposed model publicly available for comparison?**  
   - ✅ Yes. The GConsent ontology is publicly available at [ADAPT Centre](https://openscience.adaptcentre.ie/ontologies/consent/docs/index-en.html)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**  
   - ✅ Yes, the paper is in English.  

5. **Is the document publicly available or within CAPES CAFE-signed digital libraries?**  
   - ✅ Yes, it is published in a **peer-reviewed PhD dissertation** at the **University of Innsbruck**.  

6. **Is it a peer-reviewed document?**  
   - ✅ Yes, the PhD dissertation is **peer-reviewed by an academic institution**.  

**Final Verdict:** ✅ *Category: OK*  
- The paper presents **a structured semantic approach** to **model consent compliance under GDPR**.  
- It is **highly relevant** for GDPR **compliance tracking, data provenance, and legal auditing**.

## **Analysis Against GDPR Compliance Questions (CQ08-CQ65)**

### **Potentially Relevant GDPR Aspects**
The paper explores **consent representation, transparency, and accountability mechanisms** using **knowledge graphs**. Below is an evaluation:

| **Compliance Question** | **Relevance** | **Analysis** |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **CQ08: Retention periods** | ✅ Yes | The model represents consent **lifespan and expiration metadata**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. |
| **CQ09: Required actions for GDPR compliance** | ✅ Yes | Describes **automated compliance verification mechanisms**. |
| **CQ11: Consent management** | ✅ Yes | Introduces **GConsent ontology** for structured **consent states and assessments**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. |
| **CQ17: Subject Access Requests (SARs)** | ✅ Yes | Models **data access requests and processing constraints**. |
| **CQ20: Halting processing on request** | ✅ Yes | Defines **consent withdrawal mechanisms** and their implications&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. |
| **CQ25: Documenting restrictions on data protection rights** | ✅ Yes | Uses **semantic reasoning to document data access rights and constraints**. |
| **CQ28: Ensuring data accuracy and updates** | ✅ Yes | Ensures **metadata tracking for consent updates**. |
| **CQ29: Retention policies** | ✅ Yes | Defines **consent expiration and policy enforcement**. |
| **CQ33: Transparency in data usage** | ✅ Yes | Provides **visualization tools** for **enhancing consent comprehension**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. |
| **CQ37: Proactively informing users of GDPR rights** | ✅ Yes | Uses **gamification techniques** to **increase awareness**. |
| **CQ39: Third-party data processing agreements** | ✅ Yes | Discusses **data-sharing policies and third-party processing implications**. |
| **CQ51: Data deletion/anonymization** | ✅ Yes | Provides **semantically structured records for data removal requests**. |
| **CQ56: Regular review of security plans** | ✅ Yes | Models **compliance checks based on privacy principles**. |
| **CQ64: Legal basis for data transfers** | ✅ Yes | Supports **data flow tracking based on GDPR legal bases**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. |

**Summary:**  
- The paper **strongly aligns with GDPR compliance** by providing a **semantic model for consent tracking**.  
- The **knowledge graph-based approach** ensures **auditability and transparency in data processing**.
