# **Summary & Analysis**

## **Summary**

The paper **"An Empirical Study on LLM-based Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations"** by **Hassani, Sabetzadeh, and Amyot (2025)** explores the **application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying food safety regulatory provisions related to system and software requirements**. The study aims to **bridge the gap between food-safety regulations and modern automated compliance monitoring systems**.

### **Key Contributions**

1. **Grounded Theory Study of Food Safety Regulations**
    
    - Conducts an analysis of **food safety laws in Canada and the US**.
    - Identifies key **regulatory provisions relevant to system and software requirements**.
2. **Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Classification**
    
    - Experiments with **BERT and GPT models** to classify legal provisions.
    - Evaluates **fine-tuning versus few-shot learning trade-offs**.
3. **Generalizability of LLM-Based Classification**
    
    - Demonstrates **high accuracy in classifying legal provisions**.
    - Shows that **LLM-based classification can work across jurisdictions (Canada & US)**.
4. **Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Approaches**
    
    - Benchmarks **LLM-based classification against LSTM and keyword-based methods**.
    - Finds that **GPT-4o achieves the highest precision (89%) and recall (87%)**.

### **Key Findings**

- **LLMs significantly outperform traditional text classification techniques in regulatory compliance.**
- **Food safety regulations are written in a technology-agnostic way, making automated classification challenging.**
- **Fine-tuning LLMs achieves better classification accuracy than few-shot learning.**

### **Key Quotes**

- _“Food safety regulations, like many legal texts, are written to ensure long-term applicability but often lack explicit references to modern software-driven compliance mechanisms.”_ (Page 2)
- _“The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%.”_ (Page 5)
- _“Despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions.”_ (Page 8)

# **Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria**

1. **Does the paper propose a data provenance model for GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ❌ **No.** The paper focuses on **food safety regulations** and **LLM-based classification**, not GDPR data provenance modeling.
2. **Does the study address compliance questions related to GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ❌ **No.** The study is **focused on regulatory classification for food safety**, not GDPR compliance tracking.
3. **Is the proposed model publicly available?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** The paper is **publicly accessible on ArXiv**, but **ArXiv is not peer-reviewed**.
4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** The paper is in **English**.
5. **Is the document publicly available?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** Available via **ArXiv (open-access repository)**.
6. **Is the document peer-reviewed?**
    
    - ❌ **No.** The paper is **hosted on ArXiv, which does not undergo formal peer review**.

### **Final Verdict:** ❌ **Category: "Unrelated"**

The paper **focuses on food safety compliance using LLMs**, making it **unrelated to GDPR data provenance modeling**.

# **Discussion on Compliance Questions**

Since the study **focuses on food safety compliance rather than GDPR**, it **does not address any GDPR compliance questions (CQs)**.

|**Compliance Question**|**Addressed?**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|---|
|**CQ08 (Retention Periods)**|❌ **No**|The paper does not discuss **data retention policies**.|
|**CQ09 (Ensuring Compliance Actions)**|❌ **No**|The study does not provide **GDPR-specific compliance tracking mechanisms**.|
|**CQ29 (Retention Policies & Procedures)**|❌ **No**|No **structured data retention policies** are outlined in the paper.|

### **Conclusion**

The study **focuses on food safety regulatory compliance and LLM-based classification** but **does not provide structured GDPR compliance tracking mechanisms**.
