# Carl Magnus Bruhner. Bridging the Privacy Gap – a proposal for enhanced technical mechanisms to strengthen users’ privacy control online in the age of GDPR and CCPA. 2022.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper explores privacy and consent control mechanisms within web browsers, particularly focusing on an **enhanced version of the Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC) mechanism**. While the study discusses **GDPR compliance in relation to user consent**, it **does not propose a data provenance model** for tracking data activities.

The research presents **browser-based privacy solutions** that aim to **simplify user consent management** under GDPR and CCPA. However, it **does not fulfill the criteria for inclusion** in this review as it does not model **data provenance concepts**, nor does it provide a framework for tracking and verifying GDPR compliance questions.

## Justification for Category: Unrelated

- ❌ **No Data Provenance Model**: The paper does not introduce a structured model for tracking **data lineage, processing activities, or retention policies**.
- ❌ **Not Directly Related to GDPR Compliance Questions**: While it addresses GDPR consent challenges, it does not tackle **retention policies, access control, or compliance verification**.
- ❌ **Not Peer-Reviewed**: The paper is a Master’s Thesis and lacks **peer-reviewed validation**.
- ✅ **Publicly Available**: The document is accessible through Linköping University's archive.

### **Conclusion**
This paper is **not suitable for inclusion** in the dataset as it does not propose a **data provenance model** that can be used to address GDPR obligations and compliance questions.
