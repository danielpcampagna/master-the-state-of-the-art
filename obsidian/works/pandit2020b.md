due: Although this paper argues in favor of approaching GDPR issues using semantic
  models (e.g., provenance models) to support further standardization efforts, it
  does not introduce these models. Instead, the authors are concerned with providing
  an overview of existing standards and their relevance to the ecosystem brought about
  by the GDPR.
