# Raza & Ahmed (2023) - The Semantic Data Sharing Platform using Blockchain: A GDPR Perspective

This paper presents a blockchain-based semantic data-sharing platform designed for GDPR compliance. It provides a data provenance model through Hyperledger Fabric, Consent Ontology, and Data Privacy Vocabulary, ensuring compliance with GDPR obligations such as data retention, security, and consent management.

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces a **blockchain-based semantic data-sharing platform** for GDPR compliance. The system integrates:

- **Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain** for **data provenance and logging**.  
- **Semantic technologies (Consent Ontology and Data Privacy Vocabulary)** to model **compliance policies**.  
- **Decentralized storage (Interplanetary File System - IPFS)** to manage **sensitive personal data securely**.  
- **Smart contracts for access control and consent enforcement**.  

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The system **tracks data storage duration and enforces retention limits** using smart contracts.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security requirements and encryption**
- **Hyperledger Fabric ensures cryptographic security** and **role-based access control**.  

### **CQ51: Data anonymization and destruction**
- **Data is stored in IPFS**, and **only encrypted hashes are maintained on the blockchain** for compliance.  

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about GDPR rights**
- **Semantic Consent Ontology (CO)** provides **clear, machine-readable policies** for **transparency obligations**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- **Provenance smart contracts record all transactions**, ensuring compliance with **data transfer regulations**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Provides an integrated blockchain and semantic web framework for GDPR compliance**.  
✅ **Ensures immutability and transparency through smart contracts**.  
✅ **Supports secure and privacy-enhancing storage solutions**.  
❌ **No public implementation or dataset is provided**.  
❌ **Not peer-reviewed but academically rigorous**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **GDPR-compliant data-sharing frameworks**, integrating **blockchain-based provenance tracking** and **semantic web compliance technologies**. The **approach is well-structured and relevant to GDPR obligations**, making it a **valuable reference for compliance automation**.
