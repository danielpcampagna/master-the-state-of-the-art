# Jan Pennekamp et al. Privacy-Preserving Production Process Parameter Exchange. ACSAC 2020, Austin, USA, December 7–11, 2020.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper introduces a **privacy-preserving industrial data exchange framework** using **Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE)**. It addresses:

- **Secure industrial data sharing** through **cryptographic techniques** such as **Bloom filters, oblivious transfers, and private set intersections**.
- **Privacy-preserving exchange of process parameters** for **manufacturing and production optimization**.
- **Open-source implementation** demonstrating applicability in **injection molding and machine tool optimization**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on industrial data exchange. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, does not track obligations like data retention or consent management. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, but unrelated to compliance verification. |
| **Written in English?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ✅ Yes, published in ACSAC 2020. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This paper does not provide **a GDPR compliance model** or **a data provenance tracking approach**. While it contributes to **privacy-preserving industrial collaborations**, it **does not address regulatory auditing, data subject rights, or legal compliance obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
