# Evangelia Vanezi, Georgia Kapitsaki, Anna Philippou. What’s Your Purpose? An Approach to Incorporating GDPR Purposes into Requirements Analysis. ICISSP 2024, Cyprus.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper introduces **AnálisisP**, a methodology for **integrating GDPR processing purposes into system requirements analysis**. The framework extends the **Unified Modeling Language (UML) Use Case and Sequence Diagrams** to **formally define data processing purposes**. Key contributions include:

- **Purpose-aware system requirements modeling** for **ensuring GDPR compliance at design-time**.
- **Integration with DiálogoP**, enabling **formal compliance validation**.
- **Visual representations of GDPR compliance**, facilitating **software engineering best practices**.

The approach supports GDPR compliance by **incorporating privacy-by-design principles** into system requirements.
