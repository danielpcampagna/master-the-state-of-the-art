# Asgarinia, Haleh et al. *Who Should I Trust with My Data?* 2023.

## Approach and Motivations

This paper examines **trust, transparency, and ethical challenges** in **decentralized Personal Information Management Systems (PIMS)**. It highlights the **limitations of existing data governance models** and explores **the role of machine-readable policies in GDPR compliance**.

Key contributions include:
- **Evaluation of Personal Information Management Systems (PIMS)** as a data governance mechanism.  
- **Analysis of transparency mechanisms** for improving trust in data management.  
- **Discussion on machine-readable policy languages** (ODRL, DPV) for privacy compliance.  
- **Exploration of European regulatory developments** like the **Data Governance Act (DGA) and eIDAS 2**.  

Despite these contributions, **no structured data provenance model** is proposed, making it **unrelated** to the research scope.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

The **transparency and trust framework** presented in the paper supports GDPR-related discussions but **does not track data lineage or retention policies**:

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- Discusses **policy transparency** to help individuals understand how their data is used.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Analyzes **privacy notices and policy languages** to enhance transparency.

### **CQ47 - Security Program Documentation**
- Mentions **compliance tracking tools** but **lacks a detailed GDPR framework**.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- Explores **data sovereignty mechanisms** but **does not implement a structured compliance model**.

## Approach Insufficiencies

The study **does not address**:
- **Data retention policies (CQ08, CQ29)**.  
- **Automated erasure and anonymization (CQ51)**.  
- **Implementation of a structured data provenance framework**.  

## Key Contributions

- **Evaluation of trust in decentralized data governance models**.  
- **Analysis of semantic policy languages (ODRL, DPV) for GDPR compliance**.  
- **Discussion on regulatory frameworks such as the DGA and eIDAS 2**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work **analyzes emerging governance frameworks** but lacks **practical implementation** of **data provenance tracking**. Unlike GDPR-focused models, it **centers on ethical and legal trust factors in decentralized systems**.

## Conclusion

The paper **focuses on trust and governance transparency** in decentralized data management. However, **it does not introduce a data provenance model for GDPR compliance**, making it **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.
