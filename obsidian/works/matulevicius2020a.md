# Matulevicius, Raimundas and Tom, Jake and Kala, Kaspar and Sing, Eduard. A Method for Managing GDPR Compliance in Business Processes. 2020.

## Approach and Motivations

This publication introduces a comprehensive method for managing GDPR compliance within business processes. The motivation behind this approach is to address the growing need for businesses to adhere to GDPR regulations effectively. The paper is structured to provide a detailed overview of the GDPR model, methods for achieving compliance, and processes for extracting and comparing compliance models.

The approach includes several key components such as the `GDPR model`, `Method for achieving compliance`, `Extracting AS-IS compliance model`, and `Comparing two models`. These components are designed to help businesses understand their current compliance status (`AS-IS compliance model`), identify compliance issues, and make necessary changes to their business processes. The method is aimed at ensuring that businesses can systematically track, manage, and update their GDPR compliance efforts.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

The approach involves the `GDPR model` and `Method for achieving compliance` components, which can be used to outline the retention periods for different categories of personal data. However, it does not specify retention periods for each category.

### Question 28

The `GDPR model` and `Method for achieving compliance` could help ensure data accuracy and timely corrections by defining processes and responsibilities. However, the approach does not provide detailed procedures for maintaining data accuracy.

### Question 29

The `GDPR model` and `Method for achieving compliance` may assist in developing retention policies but do not explicitly address the procedures for ensuring data is held for no longer than necessary.

### Question 51

The provided method includes components that could help in managing data retention and destruction, such as `Defining compliance issues` and `Changing business process model`. However, it does not explicitly ensure that data is systematically destroyed when no longer needed.

### Question 63

The approach does not specifically address listing all transfers of data, including the nature of the data, purpose of processing, and details of the transfer.

### Question 64

While the `GDPR model` and `Method for achieving compliance` cover aspects of legal bases for processing, they do not explicitly document the legal bases for data transfers.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfill The Compliance Questions

### Question 8

The model lacks specific components for listing retention periods for each category of personal data. It primarily focuses on compliance processes rather than detailed data management guidelines.

### Question 28

The approach does not provide explicit procedures for ensuring personal data is kept up to date and accurate, nor does it describe the process for making necessary corrections without delay.

### Question 29

Although the approach includes the `GDPR model` and `Method for achieving compliance`, it does not detail the retention policies and specific procedures required to ensure data is held only as long as necessary.

### Question 51

The approach does not explicitly address the systematic destruction, erasure, or anonymization of personal data when it is no longer legally required, leaving a gap in compliance.

### Question 63

The methodology does not cover the listing of all data transfers, including detailed information about the data, purpose, and countries involved in the transfer.

### Question 64

The current model does not fully document the legal bases for data transfers, such as EU Commission adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses.

## Key Contributions

- Comprehensive method for managing GDPR compliance in business processes.
- Components introduced:
  - `GDPR model`
  - `Method for achieving compliance`
  - `Extracting AS-IS compliance model`
  - `Comparing two models`
  - `Defining compliance issues`
  - `Changing business process model`

- Background concepts include GDPR regulations and business process management.
- Evaluation includes comparing current compliance models and identifying compliance gaps.

## State-of-the-Art

This approach advances the state-of-the-art by providing an integrated method for managing GDPR compliance within business processes. It offers a structured way to extract and compare compliance models, identify issues, and implement necessary changes. This method stands out by focusing on the practical aspects of compliance management, rather than theoretical guidelines.

Related works may include other GDPR compliance frameworks and business process management models. However, this approach differentiates itself by offering a detailed method for comparing `AS-IS compliance models` and defining compliance issues, providing businesses with actionable insights for achieving GDPR compliance.
