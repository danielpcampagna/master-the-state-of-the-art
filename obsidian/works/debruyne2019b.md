due: This approach has no direct relation to provenance. This one meets the GDPR by
  proposing a tiny Data Flow Diagrams ontology, which is a data-oriented model. The
  author argues that provenance approaches are workflow-oriented and, in general,
  are focused on 'a posterior' representation. The ontology is available at https://w3id.org/dfd.
  The approach also utilizes prior ontologies to demonstrate that the model can facilitate
  the compliance verification.
