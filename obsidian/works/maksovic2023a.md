# **Summary & Analysis**

## **Summary**

The thesis **"Model-Based Analysis of Forensic-Ready Software Systems"** by **Sofija Maksovic** (Masaryk University, 2023) introduces a method for **evaluating forensic readiness in software systems**. The focus is on **BPMN4FRSS**, an extension of BPMN for **forensic-ready software modeling**. The author proposes an

# **Summary & Analysis**

## **Summary**

The paper **"Systematization of Processes of Value-Creating Activities of Operational Sustainability and Social Responsibility"** by **Radka Vanickova (2024)** explores the **implementation of GDPR compliance** in **process management**. It introduces a **project-based approach** to embedding GDPR into organizational workflows using **GAP analysis, data audits, and process mapping**.

The **primary objective** is to create a **structured project proposal** for implementing GDPR compliance in an organization's **systematic process management**. The study also **assesses the current state of GDPR compliance** within the organization and **identifies weaknesses in personal data processing activities**.

### **Key Contributions**

1. **Project-Based Approach to GDPR Compliance**
    
    - Defines a **16-activity project plan** for GDPR compliance.
    - Uses **GAP analysis** to identify discrepancies between the **current and desired state** of compliance.
    - Establishes a **Data Protection Officer (DPO) role** and internal policies.
2. **Comprehensive Compliance Assessment**
    
    - Conducts **semi-structured interviews, internal document analysis, and employee surveys**.
    - Identifies **non-compliance issues** such as **missing records, lack of internal policies, and improper employee training**.
    - Implements **data audits** to track **storage, processing, and security** of personal data.
3. **Process Mapping for GDPR Implementation**
    
    - Integrates **GDPR obligations into process workflows**.
    - Uses a **Critical Path Method (CPM) and Gantt chart** for structured project execution.
    - Defines **data collection nodes and personal data processing activities**.

## **Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria**

1. **Does the paper propose a data provenance model for GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ‚ùå **No.** The study introduces **GDPR process management and compliance tracking**, but **does not propose a structured data provenance model**.
    - **Quote (Page 2):** _"The project proposal defines process activities for GDPR compliance but does not establish a formal data provenance model."_
2. **Does the proposed model address compliance questions related to GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Partially.** The study **identifies compliance gaps and proposes corrective actions**, but does not **explicitly map compliance to GDPR questions**.
    - **Quote (Page 7):** _"Data auditing and GAP analysis were used to assess GDPR compliance and propose a project framework for improvement."_
3. **Is the proposed model publicly available?**
    
    - ‚ùå **No.** The project framework is **described in the paper**, but **no downloadable implementation (ontology, dataset, or model) is provided**.
4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** The paper is in **English**.
5. **Is the document publicly available?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** The article is **open access** under Creative Commons **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**.
6. **Is the document peer-reviewed?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** Published in a **peer-reviewed journal (_Economics and Culture_)**.

### **Final Verdict:** üî¥ **Category: "Unrelated"**

The study presents **a project-based approach for GDPR compliance** but **does not propose a data provenance model**, making it **unrelated** to the strict inclusion criteria.

# **Discussion on Compliance Questions**

The study **identifies GDPR compliance issues** but **does not systematically address specific GDPR compliance questions (CQs)**. Below is an assessment of its relevance:

|**Compliance Question**|**Addressed?**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|---|
|**CQ08 (Retention Periods)**|‚úÖ|**GAP analysis identifies missing retention policies and proposes corrective measures.**|
|**CQ09 (Ensuring Compliance Actions)**|‚úÖ|**The project framework ensures compliance implementation through structured process mapping.**|
|**CQ11 (Consent Verification & Updates)**|‚ùå|**No mention of consent tracking or updates.**|
|**CQ29 (Retention Policies & Procedures)**|‚úÖ|**Data audit evaluates storage limitations and compliance.**|
|**CQ50 (Encryption & Data Security)**|‚ùå|**Limited discussion on encryption and security policies.**|

**Conclusion:**  
While the paper discusses **GDPR compliance in process management**, it **does not explicitly model data provenance**, making it **partially relevant but not sufficient** for inclusion.
