# Mlačić (2022) - Data Protection Regulation Ontology for Compliance

This thesis presents an ontology-based framework for GDPR compliance, addressing security, data sensitivity, and privacy-enhancing technologies. It supports compliance automation and consulting use cases, directly addressing GDPR requirements such as data retention, security controls, and privacy mechanisms.
## Approach and Motivations

The thesis introduces **a structured ontology** to assist consulting firms in **automating GDPR compliance processes**. It focuses on:

- **Semantic modeling of GDPR security and privacy requirements**  
- **Integration of organizational and technical security measures**  
- **Generating compliance checklists (runbooks) for businesses**  

The ontology is **designed to facilitate GDPR audits** and **aligns with ISO/IEC 27001 and OWASP ASVS**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The ontology **models GDPR retention obligations**, helping organizations **track data storage periods**.

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security requirements and encryption**
- Supports **ISO/IEC 27001-based security controls**, ensuring **state-of-the-art encryption and risk mitigation**.

### **CQ51: Data anonymization and destruction**
- **Explicitly includes privacy mechanisms**, distinguishing **anonymization vs. pseudonymization**.

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about GDPR rights**
- Helps organizations **document processing activities** and **inform data subjects of their rights**.

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- The ontology **models cross-border data transfers**, tracking **legal justifications and required agreements**.

## Key Contributions

✅ **Provides an ontology-based compliance framework**.  
✅ **Integrates GDPR obligations with cybersecurity best practices**.  
✅ **Supports automated compliance verification for consulting firms**.  
❌ **Limited to GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001; lacks broader global regulatory coverage**.  
❌ **Not peer-reviewed, but academically rigorous as a Master’s thesis**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **regulatory compliance automation**, providing **structured, machine-readable GDPR requirements**. While **designed for consulting firms**, it **has potential for broader legal and regulatory applications**.
