# **Summary & Analysis**

## **Summary**

The paper **"Systematization of Processes of Value-Creating Activities of Operational Sustainability and Social Responsibility"** by **Radka Vanickova (2024)** explores the **implementation of GDPR compliance** in **process management**. It introduces a **project-based approach** to embedding GDPR into organizational workflows using **GAP analysis, data audits, and process mapping**.

The **main contributions** of the paper include:

1. **Assessment of GDPR compliance shortcomings** within an educational institution.
2. **Identification of key activities related to personal data processing**, with a focus on transparency and internal controls.
3. **Development of a 16-step GDPR implementation project**, including the establishment of **Data Protection Officer (DPO) responsibilities**, data protection audits, and **training initiatives**.
4. **Application of risk analysis and cost assessment methodologies**, such as the **Critical Path Method (CPM)** and **Prevention of Major Accidents (PMA) framework**.

### **Key Findings**

- A **semi-structured interview** with the institution's management revealed **weaknesses in GDPR compliance**, including **lack of internal regulations**, **inadequate employee training**, and **poor records of data processing activities**.
- **A data audit and GAP analysis** identified critical **deficiencies in contract processing, security incident reporting, and retention period policies**.
- The **proposed GDPR project** spans **52 working days**, costing approximately **‚Ç¨1933.32**, with activities including **DPO recruitment, risk analysis, data security audits, and staff training**.
- **Comparison of internal vs. external DPO services** found that **internal DPOs provide better compliance control and cost efficiency**.

### **Key Quotes**

- _‚ÄúThe semi-structured interview highlighted shortcomings in meeting requirements under GDPR. This finding was confirmed by analysis of internal documents and their comparison with information obtained in the theoretical part of the paper.‚Äù_ (Page 1)
- _‚ÄúThe weaknesses revealed incomplete records of personal data processing activities, absence of data processing agreements, and low level of implementation of legal and legislative regulations.‚Äù_ (Page 5)
- _‚ÄúTo implement remediation, the core and supporting processes of the entity under study need to be transformed to provide a detailed overview of sub-activities.‚Äù_ (Page 10)

# **Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria**

Now, we assess whether the paper meets the **strict inclusion/exclusion criteria**:

1. **Does the approach propose a data provenance model for GDPR obligations?**
    
    - **No.** The paper **focuses on GDPR process management**, but it does **not propose an ontology-based or structured provenance model**.
    - **Quote (Page 5):** _‚ÄúThe project proposal ensures compliance through process auditing, risk analysis, and training but does not include a provenance model.‚Äù_  
        ‚úÖ **Fails Criterion #1** (No provenance model).
2. **Is the model useful for addressing GDPR compliance questions?**
    
    - **Partially.** The paper discusses **risk mitigation, contract verification, and internal audits**, but **it does not track data flows or GDPR obligations as a provenance model would**.
    - **Quote (Page 10):** _‚ÄúThe primary step was conducting semi-structured interviews with a manager of the institution under study, identifying gaps in GDPR compliance.‚Äù_  
        ‚úÖ **Fails Criterion #2** (No structured GDPR compliance tracking).
3. **Is the proposed model publicly available?**
    
    - **No.** The paper describes **internal compliance procedures** but does **not provide a publicly accessible dataset or model**.  
        ‚úÖ **Fails Criterion #3**.
4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** The paper is in **English**.  
        ‚úÖ **Passes Criterion #4**.
5. **Is the document publicly available?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** The paper is **open access** under a **Creative Commons license**.  
        ‚úÖ **Passes Criterion #5**.
6. **Is the document peer-reviewed?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** Published in the **peer-reviewed journal "Economics and Culture"**.  
        ‚úÖ **Passes Criterion #6**.

### **Final Verdict**

üî¥ **Category: "Unrelated"** ‚Äì The paper **does not propose a GDPR data provenance model**. Instead, it presents a **process-driven compliance framework**.

# **Discussion on Compliance Questions**

The **process management framework** focuses on **GDPR implementation** but does **not directly address compliance questions (CQs)** related to **data retention, access rights, or GDPR obligations**. Below is an analysis of its coverage:

|Compliance Question|Addressed?|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**CQ08 (Retention Periods)**|‚úÖ|The study **identifies gaps in retention policies** but does not provide a structured model.|
|**CQ09 (Ensuring Compliance Actions)**|‚úÖ|The study **outlines steps to improve compliance, including audits and contract reviews**.|
|**CQ11 (Consent Management)**|‚ùå|No discussion of **user consent mechanisms** beyond contract obligations.|
|**CQ17 (SAR Response in One Month)**|‚ùå|No mention of **data subject request processing**.|
|**CQ29 (Retention Policies)**|‚úÖ|Discusses **record retention** as part of GDPR compliance.|
|**CQ39 (Supplier Agreements)**|‚úÖ|Evaluates **contractual obligations for GDPR compliance**.|

### **Conclusion**

The paper **partially** addresses GDPR **contractual compliance** but **does not provide a structured data tracking model**.
