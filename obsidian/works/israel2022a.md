due: This dissertation presents the MetaScriptura framework, a general-purpose data provenance model. While it discusses trust, authenticity, and provenance integrity, it does not specifically track GDPR compliance requirements. The MetaLex application focuses on legal record verification but lacks direct GDPR enforcement mechanisms.

# Israel (2022) - MetaScriptura: A General Data Provenance Framework

## Approach and Motivations

The dissertation introduces **MetaScriptura**, a **flexible, extensible data provenance framework** designed to:

- Support **provenance tracking across multiple domains**.  
- Ensure **integrity, trust, and authenticity** in metadata records.  
- Use **semantic metadata and secure storage (blockchain, RDF triple stores, ontologies)**.  

While **MetaScriptura is a general provenance model**, it **does not explicitly focus on GDPR compliance**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ51 & CQ52: Data integrity and restoration**
- The framework ensures **secure provenance metadata storage**.  
- It supports **blockchain-based immutability** and **semantic metadata tracking**.  

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about regulations**
- The MetaLex component proposes **a legal provenance model**, which could support **transparency obligations**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The framework **does not define data retention enforcement**.  

### **CQ20 & CQ25: Halting processing and restricting data use**
- The model focuses on **general data provenance** and **not personal data processing restrictions**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- While **MetaLex explores legal record tracking**, it **does not document GDPR-compliant data transfers**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ Provides a **general data provenance model**.  
✅ Uses **semantic metadata, ontologies, and blockchain for tracking**.  
✅ Supports **secure and immutable provenance storage**.  
❌ **Does not provide an explicit GDPR compliance tracking model**.  
❌ **Lacks enforcement mechanisms for retention, deletion, and personal data restrictions**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **general data provenance research**, but **does not provide a dedicated GDPR compliance solution**. While **MetaLex suggests legal record verification**, it **does not fully meet GDPR provenance obligations**.
