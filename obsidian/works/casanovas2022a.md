due: This paper discusses legal governance and regulatory models for Industry 4.0 and IoT but does not propose a GDPR data provenance model. While it explores compliance-by-design, it lacks mechanisms for tracking personal data processing, retention, or international transfers.

# Casanovas et al. (2022) - Law, Socio-Legal Governance, the Internet of Things, and Industry 4.0

## Approach and Motivations

The paper presents a **middle-out/inside-out approach** to **legal governance** in **IoT and Industry 4.0** environments. It focuses on:

- **Regulatory models for compliance-by-design**  
- **Legal frameworks for AI-driven governance**  
- **Socio-legal ecosystems for legal compliance**  

However, it **does not propose a GDPR data provenance model** and **does not track personal data activities**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about regulations**
- The paper provides **regulatory insights** into **digital law and compliance frameworks**.  
- It explores **the role of AI in governance**, helping organizations **understand compliance obligations**.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The approach **does not define** data retention policies or provide **mechanisms for enforcement**.

### **CQ20 & CQ25: Halting processing and restricting data use**
- The paper **focuses on governance strategies**, not **GDPR enforcement mechanisms**.

### **CQ51: Data anonymization and destruction**
- It **does not propose** a model for **ensuring systematic anonymization or destruction of data**.

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- The regulatory approach **discusses legal governance** but **does not address data transfer regulations explicitly**.

## Key Contributions

✅ Provides **insights into legal governance for Industry 4.0**.  
✅ Explores **compliance-by-design models**.  
✅ Introduces **concepts of legal governance and AI in regulation**.  
❌ **Does not provide a GDPR data provenance model**.  
❌ **Lacks concrete mechanisms for tracking personal data processing**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to the **field of legal governance in digital environments**, but **does not meet GDPR data tracking and provenance requirements**. It is useful for **understanding compliance strategies**, but **not for enforcing GDPR obligations**.
