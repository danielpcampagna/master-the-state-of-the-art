## **Summary & Analysis**

### **Main Idea**

The dissertation presents **Semantic Frameworks for supporting compliance with the EU AI Act's Risk Management and Documentation requirements**. It explores **Regulatory Technology (RegTech)** solutions to **facilitate compliance, improve legal certainty, and enable automated regulatory learning**. The study introduces a **compendium of Semantic Web-based artifacts**, including:

- **AI Risk Ontology (AIRO)** – foundational ontology for modeling AI risks.
- **Vocabulary of AI Risks (VAIR)** – taxonomy derived from AIRO for real-world applications.
- **AI Cards** – a machine-readable documentation framework for AI risk management.

These frameworks help ensure **Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR)** in AI risk documentation and compliance processes.

### **Key Points and Arguments by Section**

#### **Introduction (p.1-5)**

- The **EU AI Act (2024)** introduces a **risk-based framework** for regulating AI systems.
- **High-risk AI systems** must comply with **risk management, documentation, and registration requirements**.
- **Legal uncertainty** exists due to the lack of harmonized guidelines, making compliance difficult.
- **RegTech** solutions leveraging **Semantic Web** technologies offer a structured approach to **AI Act compliance**.
- **Quote**: _"Translating the AI Act’s legal provisions into practical approaches requires regulatory learning, which remains underdeveloped."_ (p.3)
- **Quote**: _"Semantic Web technologies provide structured compliance solutions by enabling automated compliance verification."_ (p.4)

---

#### **AI Risk Management and Compliance Challenges (p.6-9)**

- **Organizations struggle with risk documentation and assessment**.
- **Manual compliance efforts** are **inefficient, costly, and prone to inconsistencies**.
- **Current standards (ISO/IEC, GDPR)** provide **some guidance** but lack **formal alignment with the AI Act**.
- **Quote**: _"The AI Act’s high-risk classification mandates risk management strategies, yet no unified approach exists to define and document AI risks."_ (p.7)

---

#### **Semantic Web-based Compliance Solutions (p.10-14)**

- The study introduces **FAIR AI compliance artifacts**:
    - **AIRO (AI Risk Ontology)** for structured risk representation.
    - **VAIR (Vocabulary of AI Risks)** for defining and standardizing AI risk taxonomies.
    - **AI Cards** for **machine-readable AI documentation** to enhance regulatory transparency.
- **Quote**: _"AIRO and VAIR bridge the gap between legal and technical AI compliance requirements."_ (p.11)
- **Quote**: _"AI Cards provide a standardized, shareable format for AI risk documentation."_ (p.12)

---

#### **Case Studies & Evaluation (p.15-21)**

- The frameworks were tested in:
    - **AI governance** (ISO/IEC AI standards).
    - **High-risk AI classification** (EU AI Act Annex III).
    - **Regulatory automation** (Semantic AI documentation for legal assessments).
- **Findings**:
    - AIRO **aligns with ISO risk management principles**.
    - VAIR **enables structured AI risk categorization**.
    - AI Cards **facilitate AI risk communication between stakeholders**.
- **Quote**: _"Our evaluations confirm that Semantic Web technologies enhance AI compliance, governance, and transparency."_ (p.19)
