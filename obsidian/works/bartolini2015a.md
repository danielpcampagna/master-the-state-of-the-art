due: 'The goals of this ontology are out of the scope of our work. The authors aim
  to represent the concepts of the law instead of provenance information about activities
  related to the GDPR obligation. Although the ontology is not made public, we have
  contacted the author requesting access to the ontology. It proposes a total of 146
  classes elicited by utilizing methodologies the authors found in the literature,
  which consists of (1) defining the scope of the ontology; and (2) determining the
  hierarchy that the ontology will take. This methodology is guided by a set of competency
  questions to lead the authors to reach their goals. They also inherit classes from
  prior ontologies. The concerns about scopes, this ontology seeks to represent the
  rights and obligations of the GDPR. This ontology identify seven rights, namely:
  RightToObject, RightToRectification, RightOfAccess, RightToErasure, RightToInformation,
  RightToNoProfiling, RightToPortability.'
