due: ODRL serves as a background for our purposes rather than a possible approach.
  ODRL makes it capable of representing GDPR policy rules (rights, obligations, etc.),
  but it is not the aim of this paper to represent the GDPR itself. Instead, this
  paper only uses some obligations from the GDPR to validate the ODRL. Additionally,
  it also demonstrates how to check compliance by using ODRL.
