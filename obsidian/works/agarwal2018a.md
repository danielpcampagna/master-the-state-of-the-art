summary: 'The approach proposes a new legislative vocabulary (including new concepts)
  after demonstrating that the prior legislative vocabulary, Open Digital Rights Language
  (ODRL) lacks in representing some concepts GDPR makes use. Some of the new concepts
  are lm:Discretional (for representing non-mandatory obligation, i.e., "Soft obligation"),
  lm:Dispensation (for representing exceptions), lm:Discretional (for representing
  characteristics or constraints defined in legislation), and ml:Chapter, ml:Article
  and ml:Paragraph to reference to the legislation text (all under odrl:Policy).


  From the above, the authors show as a process divided into 5 main steps how to instantiate
  this model in order to obtain the compliance assessment system. These steps consist
  of (1) Filter the text related to obligations; (2) Identify interconnections in
  the text (e.g., which other text this obligation cites?); (3) Normalize the text,
  which consists in representing the text according to the propose legislative model
  (since this represents a hard task, they propose boilerplates for expressing obligations
  in a standard style); (4) Represent the normalized text in a machine-readable format
  (e.g., using Resource Description Framework); and finally (5) Enhance readability
  for the users (i.e., append to each obligation extra information in order to make
  it easy for users checking whether such obligation has been in place; e.g.,  terms
  definitions as Art. 4, the compliance question related to this obligation).


  Finally, the authors compare this approach capabilities against the GDPR compliance
  tools. In summary, this approach introduces: support for exceptions, where obligation
  is not applicable; management of evolving law, which ensure updating the obligation
  accordingly; and, traceability, ensuring changes in the law be easily traced to
  the corresponding obligations defined for the tool.'
