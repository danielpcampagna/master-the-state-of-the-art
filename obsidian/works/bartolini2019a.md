  BPMN with the concepts expressed in the PrOnto ontology and provide a support to
  evaluate compliance through a structured approach to verify the GDPR requirements

summary: '"The research and industrial environments are struggling to identify practical
  approaches to highlight the (new) duties of controllers of personal data and foster
  the transition of IT-based systems, services, and tools to comply with the GDPR.
  In this paper, we present a solution for enhancing the modelling of business processes
  with facilities to help evaluate the compliance with the GDPR. The proposal is based
  on a model describing the constituents of the data protection domain: a structured
  form of the legal text, an ontology of data protection concepts, and a machine-readable
  translation of the GDPR provisions. An example of application is also provided."'
