  This dissertation presents a Cloud Native Privacy Engineering framework that integrates GDPR compliance tracking through structured transparency and accountability tools, such as TILT, TIRA, Teiresias, and Hawk. These tools provide automated data provenance tracking, regulatory auditing, and compliance verification.

  This paper does not introduce a new model or extends previous ones. Actually, it is concerned with the viability of consent use in practices. Hence, it proposes a hole architecture to demonstrate this feasibility.

## Evaluation Summary

This dissertation introduces **Cloud Native Privacy Engineering**, a novel framework that integrates **GDPR compliance tracking** into cloud-based microservice architectures. It includes the following contributions:

- **TILT (Transparency Information Language and Toolkit)**: A GDPR-aligned tool for structured, machine-readable transparency information.  
- **TIRA (Transparency in RESTful Architectures)**: An OpenAPI extension that enables automated tracking of **data flows and API transparency**.  
- **Teiresias**: A **scalable data inventory system** that continuously monitors **personal data at rest**.  
- **Hawk (DevOps-driven Accountability Framework)**: A DevOps-compatible system that provides **runtime transparency and compliance monitoring**.  
- **Versatile Transparency Interfaces**: Tools designed to improve **user awareness of privacy policies** and **supervisory authority audits**.

The dissertation **directly supports GDPR obligations** through **data tracking, retention enforcement, compliance auditing, and security mechanisms**.
