due: 'Unrelated to provenance. This paper introduces a privacy vocabulary to represent
  and model concepts of the GDPR. This ontology is presented in a few modules that
  aim to represent specific topics of the law, namely: (1) Data and Document, (2)
  Agent and Role, (3) Purposes and Legal Basis, (4) Data Processing, (5) Deontic Operators,
  (6) Rights and Obligations relationships, (7) Duties and Violation. This ontology
  evaluation is presented in running European H2020 Projects.'

summary: 'This paper introduces PrOnto, an ontology that models GDPR concepts to support
  legal reasoning and compliance checking by extending LegalRuleML, which allows the
  synchronization of the legal rule language modelling with the ontology. The main
  feature of PrOnto is allowing models of deontic operators as predicates such as
  rights, obligations, permission and prohibition. The paper does not explain how
  exactly those predicates take place and should be used; however, it seems to be
  clear that those are instantiated by the creation of RDF triples. The paper lacks
  examples of how such an approach might be instantiated in real use-cases.


  Additionally, PrOnto allows the modelling of the plan that describes how something
  should be laid out and the concrete sequence of actions that were actually performed.
  Such features are important to represent the Impact Assessment Plan.'
