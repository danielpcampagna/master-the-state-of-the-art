## Evaluation Summary

This paper proposes a **model-driven approach to GDPR compliance tracking** using **UML class diagrams and OCL constraints**. The contributions include:

- **A conceptual GDPR model with full traceability to legal provisions**.
- **35 compliance rules encoded in OCL to verify GDPR obligations**.
- **A methodology for tailoring GDPR requirements to specific organizational contexts**.

The approach aims to **automate GDPR compliance verification** and **bridge legal-technical gaps in compliance assessment**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ✅ Yes, UML-based compliance modeling is presented. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ✅ Yes, using OCL-based verification rules. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, the model is described in the paper. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ❌ No, published as an arXiv preprint. |

## **Final Verdict: NOFILE**

This paper **presents a GDPR compliance modeling framework**, but **since it is an arXiv preprint (not peer-reviewed), it does not meet inclusion criteria**. While it provides valuable insights into **automated GDPR compliance tracking**, it **cannot be included in the dataset due to the lack of peer review**.
