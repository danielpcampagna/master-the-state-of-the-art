# Laurens Debackere. Enforcing Data Protection in Solid: A Policy-Oriented Framework. Ghent University, 2022.

## Evaluation Summary

This dissertation explores how the **Solid** project can enforce **GDPR compliance** by **enhancing access control mechanisms and policy enforcement**. It introduces a **reference architecture** that enables users to **govern personal data access and processing** while ensuring **regulatory compliance**.

The thesis proposes **a structured approach to managing data processing based on consent and policies**, addressing GDPR's **"data protection by design and by default"** principles. It includes **technical mechanisms** for controlling **who accesses data, under what conditions, and for what purposes**, making it **relevant for GDPR compliance tracking**.

## Relevance to Compliance Questions

| **CQ#** | **Question** | **Relevance** |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **CQ08** | Retention period for personal data? | ✅ Supports retention tracking through policy rules. |
| **CQ09** | Ensuring GDPR compliance in processing? | ✅ The framework allows enforcement of policy-driven compliance. |
| **CQ11** | Re-seeking consent if invalid? | ✅ Policy-based tracking ensures compliance with consent requirements. |
| **CQ17** | Responding to Subject Access Requests (SARs)? | ✅ The framework maintains audit trails for data access requests. |
| **CQ20** | Halting processing upon restriction request? | ✅ Policy enforcement can restrict data processing based on user revocation. |
| **CQ21** | Informing individuals of their right to object? | ❌ Not explicitly addressed. |
| **CQ25** | Documenting circumstances for data rights restrictions? | ✅ Provenance metadata can log restrictions. |
| **CQ28** | Ensuring personal data accuracy and updates? | ✅ The system supports verification and correction of personal data. |
| **CQ29** | Policies to hold data only as necessary? | ✅ The proposed model allows defining and enforcing retention policies. |
| **CQ30** | Compliance with mandatory retention periods? | ✅ Supports retention enforcement through policy mechanisms. |
| **CQ32** | Avoiding unnecessary duplication of records? | ✅ Policy-based controls prevent redundant data storage. |
| **CQ33** | Providing transparent, intelligible privacy policies? | ✅ Improves transparency by allowing user-controlled data governance. |
| **CQ35** | Ensuring up-to-date and accurate personal data? | ✅ Policy enforcement ensures personal data integrity. |
| **CQ37** | Proactively informing individuals of GDPR rights? | ✅ The Solid-based approach supports user transparency. |
| **CQ38** | Making GDPR rights information accessible? | ✅ Policies can define information disclosure mechanisms. |
| **CQ39** | Reviewing third-party data agreements? | ✅ Provides mechanisms for tracking and enforcing third-party agreements. |
| **CQ40** | Requirement to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)? | ❌ Not covered. |
| **CQ41** | Documenting reasons for not appointing a DPO? | ❌ Not covered. |
| **CQ42** | Defining escalation/reporting lines for a DPO? | ❌ Not covered. |
| **CQ43** | Publishing DPO contact details? | ❌ Not covered. |
| **CQ44** | Notifying data protection authorities of DPO details? | ❌ Not covered. |
| **CQ47** | Documented security programs for personal data? | ✅ The framework supports security and privacy-enhancing policies. |
| **CQ48** | Documented process for handling security complaints? | ✅ Supports accountability and compliance tracking. |
| **CQ49** | Assigning a security breach investigator? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ50** | Using industry-standard encryption for data transfers? | ✅ The architecture supports secure authentication and access controls. |
| **CQ51** | Ensuring systematic data deletion when no longer needed? | ✅ Policy rules enforce systematic deletion of expired data. |
| **CQ52** | Restoring access to personal data after an incident? | ✅ The framework ensures data recovery processes. |
| **CQ56** | Regularly reviewing data management plans? | ✅ Encourages ongoing evaluation of data policies. |
| **CQ57** | Fully documenting data breaches? | ✅ Provenance tracking logs security-related events. |
| **CQ58** | Cooperation in handling data breaches? | ✅ Supports interorganizational compliance tracking. |
| **CQ63** | Listing and documenting all data transfers? | ✅ The architecture supports tracking of cross-system data movements. |
| **CQ64** | Ensuring legal bases for international data transfers? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ65** | Informing data subjects about international transfers? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |

## Justification for Category: OK

- ✅ **Proposes a Data Provenance Model**: The **policy-based authorization** framework enables GDPR compliance tracking.
- ✅ **Addresses GDPR Compliance Questions**: The model supports **data retention, tracking, access management, and accountability**.
- ✅ **Publicly Available Model**: The described framework is **openly accessible**.
- ✅ **Written in English**: The dissertation is available in **English**.
- ❌ **Not Peer-Reviewed**: As a dissertation, it **lacks formal peer review**, but references prior peer-reviewed work.

### **Conclusion**
This dissertation is **suitable for inclusion** in the dataset as it **proposes a policy-driven data governance model** that directly addresses GDPR-related obligations and compliance verification.
