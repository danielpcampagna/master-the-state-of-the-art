# Warfman, Niels. *A Framework for Implementing the IEC CIM - Interoperability and Consent in the Energy Retail Market.* 2024.

## Approach and Motivations

This study presents a **CIM-based implementation framework** to standardize **data interoperability** in the **energy retail market**. It introduces a **consent business process** for **managing personal data exchange** in compliance with **GDPR requirements**.

Key contributions include:
- Development of a **CIM implementation framework** to improve **data exchange interoperability**.
- Introduction of a **Consent Business Process Model** for managing **data requests and authorizations**.
- Validation of the **proposed consent model** through a case study in the **energy retail market**.

Despite these contributions, the study **does not propose a data provenance model**, which is a core requirement for inclusion.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

Although the **consent management model** does not address **data provenance**, it touches upon **GDPR compliance** in the following areas:

### **CQ11 - Consent Validity**
- The **Consent Business Process Model** ensures that **data requests** are authorized under GDPR.

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- The framework aligns with **GDPR obligations for transparent data sharing**.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Proposes a **structured process** for consent-based **data exchange**.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 - Data Retention Periods**
- No **explicit definition** of **data retention policies**.

### **CQ29 - Retention Policies**
- Lacks a **formal data governance** structure for **long-term compliance**.

### **CQ51 - Data Erasure and Anonymization**
- Does **not define** systematic **data destruction or anonymization**.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- The **framework does not track** all **data exchange activities**.

### **CQ64 - Legal Basis for Data Transfers**
- The model is **not designed for GDPR documentation** of **data transfer justifications**.

## Key Contributions

- **Interoperability Framework:** Introduces a **CIM-based workflow** for **energy data exchange**.
- **Consent Management Process:** Establishes a **standardized consent request and approval model**.
- **Practical Validation:** Demonstrates **applicability** within a real-world **energy retail** case study.

## State-of-the-Art

The study expands **CIM adoption** but does not contribute to **data provenance research**. Unlike **data lineage models**, this work focuses on **improving data sharing procedures**.

## Conclusion

While the study introduces a **valuable consent management approach**, it **does not propose a data provenance model** or GDPR data tracking framework. Therefore, it is **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.
