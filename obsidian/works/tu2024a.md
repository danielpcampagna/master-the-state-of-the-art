## Evaluation Summary

This paper presents a **BERT-based Android privacy policy and permission consistency analysis engine**. The methodology includes:

- **Analyzing discrepancies between declared permissions in privacy policies and actual usage in APKs**.
- **Using machine learning models (CNN, GRU, LSTM, BERT) for automated privacy policy evaluation**.
- **Developing a dataset of Chinese privacy policies and applying NLP techniques for policy validation**.

While the study contributes to **privacy policy consistency verification**, it **does not propose a GDPR compliance model or a legal tracking framework**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on Android privacy policy inconsistencies. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, it does not provide compliance verification mechanisms. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, the policy analysis engine is described in the paper. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ✅ Yes, published in a peer-reviewed journal. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This paper **analyzes Android privacy policy consistency** but **does not propose a GDPR compliance model or data tracking framework**. While it contributes to **privacy policy validation**, it **does not align with GDPR obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
