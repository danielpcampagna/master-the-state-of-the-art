## 1) Are Knowledge Graphs Ready for the Real World? Challenges and Perspective (pp.1–70)

**Summary of Key Points:**  
This section describes a seminar exploring open research directions for deploying Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in real-world applications. It examines the incremental creation of KGs, issues of quality, privacy, software methods, and skill sets required to manage KGs.

**Three Representative Quotations:**

1. “The real-world application of KGs requires programming paradigms for KG management, transparent data integration and quality assessment techniques, and methods for maintaining access control and privacy.” (p.2)
2. “We brought together interdisciplinary researchers from academia and industry to discuss foundations, concepts, and implementations that will pave the way for the next generation of KGs.” (p.3)
3. “The seminar addressed these socio-technical challenges with a mix of invited talks, lightning talks, and small group workshops.” (p.4)

**Main Arguments:**

- KGs need robust formal underpinnings and improved tooling to scale in industrial and enterprise contexts.
- Comprehensive discussion of data integration, privacy, and decentralized environments is necessary for broad adoption.
- Educational efforts on best practices, skill sets, and training are essential to form a new generation of “knowledge engineers.”

## 2) Beyond-Planar Graphs: Models, Structures and Geometric Representations (pp.71–94)

**Summary of Key Points:**  
This seminar focuses on geometric and topological models for graph drawing and visualization, specifically investigating beyond-planar graphs. Researchers address challenges in graph-theoretic structures that extend beyond strict planarity concepts, aiming to devise advanced geometric representations.

**Three Representative Quotations:**

1. “We explored how to understand and represent graphs that allow limited edge crossings but maintain desirable geometric properties.” (p.72)
2. “Attendees agreed on the necessity of new theoretical frameworks that can both capture real-world complexity and support tractable algorithms.” (p.73)
3. “Shared interests spanned from classic planar graph drawing to modern approaches that handle partial planarity or constrained crossings.” (p.90)

**Main Arguments:**

- Classic planar graph constraints are too restrictive for many practical use cases with large, complex networks.
- Beyond-planar models open new avenues for data visualization, geometric algorithms, and theoretical insights in computational geometry.

## 3) Safety Assurance for Autonomous Mobility (Dagstuhl Seminar 24071) (pp.95–119)

**Summary of Key Points:**  
This part examines how to ensure safety and reliability in autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles). It includes discussions on formal methods, testing, verification, and standardization efforts for advanced mobility technologies.

**Three Representative Quotations:**

1. “Safety assurance in autonomous mobility spans robust perception, real-time decision making, and fail-safe mechanisms.” (p.96)
2. “Participants highlighted the need for cooperative regulation and standards, reflecting the cross-border nature of autonomous vehicle technologies.” (p.97)
3. “Proposals for new testing procedures emphasized scenario-based simulations and hardware-in-the-loop approaches.” (p.105)

**Main Arguments:**

- Traditional software testing is insufficient for autonomous mobility; integrated, scenario-driven assurance is required.
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration is vital for coordinating regulation, certification, and acceptance of self-driving systems.

## 5) Computational Approaches to Strategy and Tactics in Sports (Dagstuhl Seminar 24081) (pp.164–181)

**Summary of Key Points:**  
This seminar studies data-driven methods for analyzing sports strategy. Emphasis is on machine learning, sensor analytics, and computational approaches to improve performance analysis, tactics, and decision-making in team and individual sports.

**Three Representative Quotations:**

1. “Sports data are inherently spatiotemporal, requiring specialized models capable of capturing dynamic interactions.” (p.165)
2. “We see a growing demand from coaches and athletes for real-time insights that can adjust tactics during a match.” (p.168)
3. “Machine learning, combined with domain expertise, offers unprecedented possibilities for evaluating player performance and strategizing.” (p.175)

**Main Arguments:**

- Advanced analytics in sports help uncover patterns that transcend traditional “box-score” statistics.
- Collaboration between data scientists, coaches, and sport professionals is crucial to operationalize AI-driven tactics.

3. “Participants stressed that ‘AI for social good’ must address bias and incorporate inclusive design principles from the outset.” (p.187)

**Main Arguments:**

- AI holds promise for public-sector and humanitarian applications, but fairness, privacy, and inclusivity must be central to system design.
- Cross-sector partnerships enhance solution relevance and sustainability.

# Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria

Below are the user’s inclusion/exclusion criteria and how this document meets or fails each:

1. **Proposes a data provenance model for GDPR obligations?**
    
    - **No.** None of the reports deals with a data provenance model specifically tied to GDPR compliance.  
        (No direct reference to “represent activities information related to GDPR obligations.”)
2. **Model should be useful for addressing the compliance questions on data retention, subject rights, etc.?**
    
    - **No.** The text does not provide or describe such a model.
3. **Model should be publicly available to compare with other approaches?**
    
    - **No specific model** for provenance or GDPR was presented; hence there is no publicly available model.
4. **Document is in English or Portuguese?**
    
    - **Yes.** The entire set of reports is in English.
5. **Document is publicly available or accessible under libraries?**
    
    - **Yes.** Dagstuhl Seminar reports are openly available online.
6. **Peer-reviewed document?**
    
    - **Yes.** Dagstuhl Reports are formal publications documenting peer-reviewed seminars.

### Conclusion of Evaluation

Although the publication is in English, publicly available, and peer-reviewed, it **does not propose a data provenance model related to GDPR** nor address compliance obligations. Therefore, it does **not** fulfill the core inclusion criteria (1–3) regarding GDPR or data provenance modeling. It is deemed **unrelated** to the targeted scope.

# Discussion on Compliance Questions

The user has provided a set of compliance questions (CQ08, CQ09, CQ11, etc.) aimed at verifying GDPR obligations (e.g., data retention, valid consent, data subject rights, etc.).

**Discussion**  
Because this volume of Dagstuhl Reports does not present or discuss any model or framework related to GDPR compliance, it **does not** address these compliance questions in any meaningful way. Specifically:

- **Data retention periods (CQ08, CQ29, CQ30),** and other obligations regarding restricting processing, halting processing, or responding to SARs (CQ17, CQ20, etc.) are **not** explored in any of these seminars.
- **Consent management (CQ11)** or **documented reasons for not having a DPO (CQ40, CQ41, etc.)** are never mentioned.
- **Security measures, data breach protocols (CQ47, CQ48, CQ57, CQ58)** are not discussed.
- **International data transfers (CQ63, CQ64, CQ65)** are likewise not covered.

Hence, there is **no evidence** that the seminars or articles address any of the compliance questions listed, nor that any of the knowledge graph or other frameworks in the text consider GDPR obligations.
