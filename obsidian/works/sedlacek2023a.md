# Tomáš Sedláček. Web-Based Editor for BPMN4FRSS Models. Bachelor's Thesis, Masaryk University, 2023.

## Evaluation Summary

This thesis introduces a **web-based editor for BPMN4FRSS (Business Process Model and Notation for Forensic-Ready Software Systems)**. The research focuses on:

- **Forensic readiness modeling in software engineering**.
- **Development of a BPMN4FRSS graphical editor** using **TypeScript and React.js**.
- **Integration of forensic security measures into business process modeling**.

While the thesis discusses **security concerns and forensic investigations**, it **does not introduce a GDPR data provenance model or compliance framework**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on forensic readiness modeling. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, it does not provide compliance verification mechanisms. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, BPMN4FRSS is available on GitHub. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ❌ No, it is a bachelor's thesis. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This thesis **does not provide a structured GDPR compliance model** or **address GDPR-related compliance tracking**. While it contributes to **forensic software engineering**, it **does not align with GDPR obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
