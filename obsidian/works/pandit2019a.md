summary: Consent is one of the legal basis for processing personal data under the
  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is the current Eurpoean data protection
  law enforced from 25th May 2018. GDPR stipulates obligations on how consent should
  be obtained, used, modified, and recorded. Additionally, it provides data subjects
  with the right to modify or withdraw their consent at any time. Demonstrating compliance
  to these rights and obligations requires maintaining information about the consent
  lifecycle. Existing work has demonstrated the feasibility of using semantic web
  technologies to represent and query this information. GConsent is an OWL2 ontology
  for representing consent for GDPR compliance. The ontology is based on an analysis
  of modelling metadata requirements related to the consent lifecycle for GDPR compliance.
  It allows modelling and representation of information related to compliance in an
  extensible and comprehensive manner.
