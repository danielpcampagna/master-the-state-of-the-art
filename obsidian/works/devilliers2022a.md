# De Villiers, Zita Kim. *A Framework for Ethical Data Use to Improve Personalised Customer Experience in the Financial Industry in South Africa.* 2022.

## Approach and Motivations

This study presents a **conceptual framework** for ensuring **ethical data use** in **financial services**, particularly in customer analytics. The research explores **data governance, privacy, transparency, and trust**, proposing a **framework to support ethical analytics**.

Key contributions include:
- **Analysis of ethical data practices** in **financial institutions**.
- **Comparison of existing data ethics frameworks**, including **GDPR, POPIA, and LGPD**.
- **Development of an ethical data use framework** to guide financial institutions.
- **Evaluation of the framework against a case study in the financial sector**.

Despite these contributions, the study **does not propose a data provenance model**, which is a core requirement for inclusion.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

The **ethical data framework** does not focus on **provenance tracking** but addresses **some GDPR compliance aspects**:

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- The study emphasizes **transparency and trust** in **data analytics processes**.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Promotes **ethical customer data management** but lacks **technical data tracking mechanisms**.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 - Data Retention Periods**
- No structured framework for **data retention management**.

### **CQ29 - Retention Policies**
- Does not define **long-term data storage policies**.

### **CQ51 - Data Erasure and Anonymization**
- Lacks **systematic procedures** for **data erasure**.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- Does **not track data movement** across systems.

### **CQ64 - Legal Basis for Data Transfers**
- Focuses on **ethics** rather than **documenting legal justifications for data processing**.

## Key Contributions

- **Ethical Data Use Framework:** Establishes **guidelines for responsible data analytics**.
- **Comparative Legal Analysis:** Compares **POPIA, GDPR, LGPD, and CCPA** regulations.
- **Case Study Validation:** Applies framework to **financial industry challenges**.

## State-of-the-Art

This study enhances **ethical data governance** but does not **introduce data lineage tracking**. Unlike **data provenance models**, this research **focuses on high-level ethical principles** rather than **data accountability mechanisms**.

## Conclusion

While this study provides **a valuable ethical data framework**, it **does not propose a data provenance model** or GDPR compliance tracking framework. Therefore, it is **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.
