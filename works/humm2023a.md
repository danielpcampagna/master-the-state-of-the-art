# Humm, Bernhard G. et al. *New directions for applied knowledge-based AI and machine learning.* 2023.

## Approach and Motivations

This paper presents **selected new directions in knowledge-based AI and machine learning (ML)**, covering topics such as:
- **Ontology engineering** for AI-driven applications.  
- **Semantic search** innovations.  
- **Supply network modeling with W3C PROV-O**.  
- **Hybrid AI approaches combining ML and knowledge-based AI**.  

Key contributions include:
- **Evaluation of AI-driven anomaly detection in manufacturing**.  
- **Use of semantic technologies in circular economy initiatives**.  
- **Semantic enrichment of technical information for compliance tracking**.  

Despite these contributions, **no structured GDPR data provenance model is proposed**, making it **unrelated** to the research scope.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

While the study explores **semantic data modeling**, it does not directly address **GDPR compliance tracking**:

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- Discusses **ontology-based modeling** for structured knowledge representation.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Mentions **semantic frameworks** that improve **data visibility and interpretation**.

### **CQ47 - Security Program Documentation**
- Introduces **ontology-driven supply chain modeling**, but **not security compliance tracking**.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- Uses **W3C PROV-O** for **supply chain tracking**, though it is **not GDPR-specific**.

## Approach Insufficiencies

The study **does not address**:
- **Data retention policies (CQ08, CQ29)**.  
- **Automated erasure and anonymization (CQ51)**.  
- **Implementation of a structured GDPR compliance model**.  

## Key Contributions

- **Review of AI-driven approaches for knowledge representation**.  
- **Discussion of semantic search and its applications**.  
- **Exploration of hybrid AI methodologies**.  

## State-of-the-Art

The paper **analyzes AI-driven knowledge representation techniques** but **does not propose a dedicated GDPR compliance model**. It is **valuable for AI research** but **not focused on data provenance tracking**.

## Conclusion

The paper **focuses on AI, semantic search, and supply chain modeling**, with **limited relevance to GDPR compliance and data provenance**. While it explores **ontology-driven modeling**, it **does not introduce a structured compliance model**, making it **unrelated**.
