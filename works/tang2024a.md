# Peng Tang, Xin Li, Yuxin Chen, Weidong Qiu, Haochen Mei, Allison Holmes, Fenghua Li, Shujun Li. A Comprehensive Study on GDPR-Oriented Analysis of Privacy Policies: Taxonomy, Corpus and GDPR Concept Classifiers. arXiv preprint, 2024.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper presents an **automated GDPR-oriented privacy policy analysis framework**, focusing on:

- **Developing a taxonomy of GDPR-related concepts**.  
- **Constructing a privacy policy corpus annotated with GDPR compliance attributes**.  
- **Training GDPR concept classifiers to detect compliance and non-compliance in privacy policies**.

The study offers **a structured approach to GDPR privacy policy analysis**, but **since it is an arXiv preprint (not peer-reviewed), it does not meet inclusion criteria**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ✅ Yes, the paper introduces an automated compliance taxonomy. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ✅ Yes, the model detects compliance in privacy policies. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, corpus and classifiers are publicly available. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ❌ No, published as an arXiv preprint. |

## **Final Verdict: NOFILE**

This paper **proposes a GDPR-oriented privacy policy analysis framework**, but **since it is an arXiv preprint (not peer-reviewed), it does not meet inclusion criteria**. While it provides valuable insights into **privacy policy compliance automation**, it **cannot be included in the dataset due to the lack of peer review**.
