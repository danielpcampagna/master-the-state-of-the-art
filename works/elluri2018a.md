  can not contribute to our purposes.

summary: '"Big data analytics related to consumer behavior, market analysis, opinions,
  and recommendation often deal with end user''s derived and inferred data, along
  with the observed data. To ensure consumer data protection, rules defined by the
  European Union''s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) must be adhered to
  by every organization using Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data for Big
  Data analysis. Similarly, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
  has policy guidelines specifically for organizations handling consumer''s payment
  card data. Both data regulation policies are currently available only in textual
  format and require significant manual effort to ensure their compliance. We have
  developed an integrated, semantically rich Knowledge Graph (or Ontology) to represent
  the rules mandated by both PCI DSS and EU GDPR. In the Ontology, we have also identified
  the obligations defined in these regulations and related them with corresponding
  Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) controls. We have validated this Knowledge Graph against
  the data policies of major vendors that deal with Big Data. This Knowledge Graph
  that is available in the public domain can be used by Big Data practitioners to
  automate data protection compliance in their organization."'
