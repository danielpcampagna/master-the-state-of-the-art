## Evaluation Summary

This paper proposes an **educational framework for Human-Data Interaction (HDI) courses**, emphasizing:

- **Data literacy and education for future computing professionals**.
- **Privacy awareness in data science education**.
- **Curriculum development for undergraduate and graduate HDI programs**.

While the research discusses **privacy concerns and ethical aspects of data usage**, it **does not provide a GDPR compliance tracking system or a data provenance model**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on educational curriculum. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, it does not provide compliance monitoring or auditing. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, but unrelated to compliance verification. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ✅ Yes, published in Journal on Interactive Systems. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This paper **does not provide a structured GDPR compliance model** or **a data provenance tracking framework**. While it contributes to **privacy education**, it **does not address regulatory auditing, data subject rights, or legal compliance obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
