However, it does not propose a data provenance model for GDPR obligations, nor does it address compliance-related data management. The approach is not applicable to the broader GDPR compliance questions.

# Gonzalez (2021) - Towards an Ontology-based Approach to the "New Normality" after COVID-19

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces an **ontology-based framework** designed to model **legal restrictions** imposed in Spain during the **first wave of COVID-19** (March-June 2020). It aims to:

- Provide **semantic structuring of legal decrees** issued during the pandemic.  
- Offer a **machine-readable legal framework** for pandemic-related restrictions.  
- Support **decision-making applications** with **ontology-based queries**.  

However, it **does not propose a data provenance model** for **tracking GDPR compliance activities**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about regulations**
- The ontology enables **structured representation of legal obligations**.  
- It can **document legislative changes** to inform the public.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The model **does not track personal data lifecycles** or **enforce deletion policies**.

### **CQ20 & CQ25: Halting processing and restricting data use**
- The ontology **models legal norms**, but does **not enforce GDPR restrictions on data processing**.

### **CQ51: Data anonymization and destruction**
- There is **no mechanism to enforce anonymization, erasure, or retention limits**.

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- The ontology **does not document** data transfers or their legal justifications.

## Key Contributions

✅ Provides a **framework for legal regulation modeling**.  
✅ Uses **semantic web technologies** for legal compliance structuring.  
✅ Ensures **machine-readable legal frameworks**.  
❌ **Does not provide a full data provenance model**.  
❌ **Lacks tracking mechanisms for personal data management**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **legal knowledge structuring**, but **is not applicable to GDPR data provenance modeling**. While useful for **tracking legal decrees**, it **does not meet the broader requirements of GDPR compliance**.
