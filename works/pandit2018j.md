due: This approach does not propose a provenance model. Before, it concerns preparing
  the grounds for a commonality between terms used in further models. It was done
  by exploring the information flows influenced by the GDPR, which led to identifying
  entities involved in such flows and their relations. The methodology employed considers
  an analysis of the relevant articles for each entity. Thus, we think this paper
  is out of our scope.
