# Xengie Cheng Doan. A Framework for User-Centered, Legal-Ethical Collective Consent Models: Genomic Data Sharing. Université du Luxembourg, 2024.

## Evaluation Summary

This dissertation introduces a **structured framework for collective consent** in genomic data sharing, with key contributions in:

- **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) for Consent Management**: Enables **automated tracking of consent lifecycle and compliance auditing**.
- **Contextual Integrity-Based Consent Framework**: Provides **structured information flows** for legal-ethical evaluation of consent policies.
- **User-Centered Consent Mechanisms**: Investigates **transparency-enhancing methods** (infographics, interactive dashboards) to improve user decision-making.
- **Analysis of GDPR Compliance Gaps**: Maps **legal-ethical conflicts in consent management**, particularly in **data retention, informed consent, and privacy governance**.

These contributions **directly support GDPR compliance** for **data tracking, retention, and security management**.

| **CQ52** | Restoring access to personal data after an incident? | ✅ Consent tracking enables **recovery mechanisms for lost data permissions**. |
| **CQ56** | Regularly reviewing data management plans? | ✅ Continuous evaluation of **legal-ethical compliance requirements**. |
| **CQ57** | Fully documenting data breaches? | ✅ BPMN logs **document security and compliance events**. |
| **CQ58** | Cooperation in handling data breaches? | ✅ The framework facilitates **data-sharing accountability**. |
| **CQ63** | Listing and documenting all data transfers? | ✅ BPMN **tracks consent for cross-system data movements**. |
| **CQ64** | Ensuring legal bases for international data transfers? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
