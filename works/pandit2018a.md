summary: This work presents a proof-of-concept demonstrating the use of semantic web
  technologies to address GDPR compliance obligations. This demonstration takes place
  by modelling the GDPR readiness checklist published by Ireland's Data Protection
  Commissioner's office as an authoritative document into prior published ontologies
  after it is mapped use-cases in SPARQL queries for automating the retrieval of information
  related to these queries.
