# Loosman & Nickel (2022) - Towards a Design Toolkit of Informed Consent Models Across Fields: A Systematic Review

## Approach and Motivations

The paper presents **a systematic review of informed consent models** across fields, focusing on:

- **Consent model trends in medicine, data science, and ethics**.  
- **Challenges of digital consent and user transparency**.  
- **Comparison of different models (e.g., broad, dynamic, and tiered consent)**.  

However, it **does not propose a GDPR-specific data provenance framework**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about consent models**  
- **Analyzes how informed consent works in different digital environments**.  

### **CQ11 & CQ51: Consent tracking and documentation**  
- **Explores challenges of digital consent models**, but **does not define legal compliance mechanisms**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**  
- **Does not propose any GDPR-aligned data retention model**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security and encryption**  
- **No mechanisms for encryption, access control, or GDPR protection**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**  
- **Focuses on ethical models of consent, not regulatory compliance enforcement**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Provides a systematic review of consent models across multiple fields**.  
✅ **Highlights challenges of digital consent in technology and health research**.  
✅ **Identifies common themes in consent models for future application**.  
❌ **Not designed for GDPR compliance or legal enforcement**.  
❌ **No retention policies, security, or provenance tracking mechanisms**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **ethical and theoretical discussions on informed consent**, providing **a structured overview of consent models across disciplines**. However, **it does not directly address GDPR compliance tracking, security, or retention policies**.
