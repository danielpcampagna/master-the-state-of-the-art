due: 'This approach introduces a usage policy language, which addresses terms and
  activities to specify a set of authorized operations. The SPECIAL Usage Policy language
  specifically represents five elements as the minimum core model: the data item,
  the purpose, the process, the storage, and the recipient. The approach was submitted
  to scientific publications along with its construction. The ontology is publicly
  available at https://ai.wu.ac.at/policies/policylanguage/.


  Since this document is not a scientific document, it was not tracked by the Google
  Scholar search engine, and thus it was not possible to roll it in the Snowballing
  process.'
