# Carl Magnus Bruhner et al. Bridging the Privacy Gap: Enhanced User Consent Mechanisms on the Web. MADWeb 2023, San Diego, USA, March 3, 2023.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper presents **ADPC+**, an improved **browser-based consent management system** that aims to enhance **user privacy** and **compliance with GDPR and CCPA**. The approach focuses on:

- **Reducing privacy gaps in user consent mechanisms** through **browser-level privacy settings**.
- **Expanding the Advanced Data Protection Control (ADPC) mechanism** to provide **better legal compliance for websites**.
- **Enhancing user experience by reducing cookie consent banners** and integrating **machine-readable privacy preferences**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on user-driven privacy settings. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, does not track obligations like data retention or consent management. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, but unrelated to compliance verification. |
| **Written in English?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ✅ Yes, published in MADWeb 2023. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This paper **does not provide a structured GDPR compliance model** or **a data provenance tracking framework**. While it contributes to **privacy-preserving consent management**, it **does not address regulatory auditing, data subject rights, or legal compliance obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
