due: This paper does not present a model for the GDPR. However, it might be helpful
  due to the advanced usage of any model. In the previous work, the authors proposed
  a model to represent the activities related to the GDPR and demonstrate the use
  of semantic web technologies to allow querying compliance-related information by
  describing them using SPARQL. However, in this publication, no model has been introduced.

summary: '"Semantic web technologies provide an open and adaptable framework for compliance
  regarding the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our previous work in this
  regard demonstrates the use of SPARQL for querying provenance of consent and personal
  data lifecycles for compliance. We extend this work through our model for evaluation
  of GDPR compliance using SHACL to validate the correctness and completeness of information.
  The model describes the creation of a compliance graph consisting of information
  required to document and demonstrate compliance linked to specific articles and
  obligations within the GDPR using the GDPRtEXT vocabulary."'
