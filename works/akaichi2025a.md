# Akaichi & Kirrane (2025) - A Comprehensive Review of Usage Control Frameworks

## Approach and Motivations

The paper presents a **comprehensive survey of existing usage control frameworks**, focusing on:

- **Policy languages and models for enforcing access control**.  
- **Mechanisms for policy enforcement, compliance tracking, and auditing**.  
- **Comparison of usage control systems for decentralized and cloud environments**.  

However, it **does not propose a GDPR-specific data provenance framework**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about AI and data governance**  
- The review **analyzes frameworks that promote transparency in data usage policies**.  

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and provenance tracking**  
- Some frameworks **support provenance tracking**, but **no specific GDPR-compliant model is proposed**.  

### **CQ51: Data accountability and security**  
- **Discusses enforcement mechanisms for access control**, but **does not define GDPR-compliant data accountability policies**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ11: Consent tracking**  
- The survey **does not include models for GDPR consent tracking**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security and encryption**  
- **No mechanisms for encryption or access control tailored for GDPR compliance**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**  
- **Focuses on policy languages, not legal compliance mechanisms for cross-border data transfers**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Comprehensive review of usage control frameworks**.  
✅ **Analyzes policy enforcement mechanisms for privacy and access control**.  
✅ **Provides a taxonomy of policy languages and enforcement strategies**.  
❌ **Not designed for GDPR compliance or personal data tracking**.  
❌ **No enforcement mechanisms for GDPR obligations**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **access control and policy enforcement research**, providing **a structured comparison of frameworks for decentralized environments**. However, **it does not directly address GDPR compliance tracking, data retention, or security enforcement**.
