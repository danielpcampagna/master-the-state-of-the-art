due: 'In this paper, the authors have developed an ontology-based data protection
  knowledge graph that shows the relationship between concepts of information security
  and the GDPR. The proposed ontology identifies five main areas scoped into the GDPR
  using the recommended process for building ontologies [19]: Data, organization,
  principles, rights, and obligations.


  Additional to the main relations within these areas, the authors have presented
  high-level ontology classes and relations, which include Data, Person (Data Subject,
  Controller, Processor), Data Subject Rights, Organization, Obligation (Controller
  obligations, Processor obligations, Data Security).


  After all, the paper explicitly notes that the ontology has not been evaluated and
  the ontology is not made publicly available. For that reason, we have discarded
  this publication.
