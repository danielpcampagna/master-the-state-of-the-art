## **Evaluation Against Inclusion Criteria**

1. **Does the paper propose a data provenance model to represent activities related to GDPR obligations?**  
   - ✅ Yes. The paper presents **IoT-Reg, a knowledge graph ontology** that represents **data privacy regulations and compliance obligations** across different IoT regulatory frameworks&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
   - It introduces **a layered ontology model** that integrates **GDPR's data processing rules**, retention policies, and security obligations.  

2. **Is the proposed model useful to address the compliance questions?**  
   - ✅ Yes. IoT-Reg **enables real-time regulatory compliance verification** and **provides structured rules for consent tracking, data retention, and processing accountability**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
   - It maps **specific GDPR articles (e.g., Article 5 on data processing, Article 17 on data deletion, and Article 28 on data processor obligations)**.  

3. **Is the proposed model publicly available for comparison?**  
   - ✅ Yes. The ontology structure and compliance mappings are described in the paper, and the **IoT-Reg ontology is publicly available for implementation**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**  
   - ✅ Yes, the paper is in English.  

5. **Is the document publicly available or within CAPES CAFE-signed digital libraries?**  
   - ✅ Yes, it is published in the **IEEE BigData 2023 Workshop Proceedings**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

6. **Is it a peer-reviewed document?**  
   - ✅ Yes, it is **peer-reviewed** and presented at **a major academic conference**.  

**Final Verdict:** ✅ *Category: OK*  
- The paper presents **a GDPR-compliant knowledge graph model** specifically designed for **regulatory alignment across IoT data ecosystems**.  
- It is **highly relevant** for GDPR **data governance, compliance enforcement, and accountability mechanisms**.

| **CQ11: Consent management** | ✅ Yes | The model integrates **user consent tracking mechanisms**, ensuring **compliance with GDPR Article 6**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. |
| **CQ17: Subject Access Requests (SARs)** | ✅ Yes | The **knowledge graph enables SAR processing and compliance tracking**. |
| **CQ20: Halting processing on request** | ✅ Yes | IoT-Reg **implements rules to stop data processing upon consent withdrawal**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. |
| **CQ25: Documenting restrictions on data protection rights** | ✅ Yes | The ontology **documents access control mechanisms and legal restrictions**. |
| **CQ28: Ensuring data accuracy and updates** | ✅ Yes | IoT-Reg models **data processing accuracy constraints and accountability requirements**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. |
| **CQ29: Retention policies** | ✅ Yes | The framework supports **automated retention enforcement** based on **GDPR rules**. |
| **CQ33: Transparency in data usage** | ✅ Yes | IoT-Reg **enhances transparency by linking regulatory requirements to data lifecycle events**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. |
| **CQ37: Proactively informing users of GDPR rights** | ✅ Yes | IoT-Reg **integrates ontology-based policy representation for user awareness**. |
| **CQ39: Third-party data processing agreements** | ✅ Yes | The framework **formalizes third-party processing compliance within the IoT domain**. |
| **CQ51: Data deletion/anonymization** | ✅ Yes | IoT-Reg includes **data deletion and anonymization policies under GDPR Article 17**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. |
