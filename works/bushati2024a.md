# Bushati et al. (2024) - What is in your cookie box? Explaining ingredients of web cookies with knowledge graphs

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces **OntoCookie**, a **knowledge graph-based ontology for cookie consent transparency**. The ontology:

- **Models cookies, consent logs, and privacy policies in a machine-readable format**.  
- **Aims to enhance transparency and user awareness of cookie-based data sharing**.  
- **Uses a semantic approach to visualize cookies and their implications**.  

However, it **does not propose a GDPR-specific compliance tracking or data provenance model**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about cookie consent transparency**  
- **Enables visualization of cookies and consent logs to improve user awareness**.  

### **CQ11 & CQ51: Tracking of given consent and data usage**  
- **Uses a knowledge graph to store structured data about consent actions**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**  
- The model **does not enforce GDPR-compliant retention policies for personal data**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security and encryption**  
- **Lacks mechanisms for encryption, security, or GDPR access control**.  

### **CQ57: Documentation of data breaches**  
- **No support for documenting security incidents or privacy breaches**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Proposes a semantic model for cookie consent transparency**.  
✅ **Enhances user awareness of data sharing implications**.  
✅ **Supports structured knowledge representation using a knowledge graph**.  
❌ **Not designed for GDPR-wide compliance tracking**.  
❌ **Limited to cookies; does not address broader GDPR obligations**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **semantic data governance and consent awareness**, providing **a structured model for cookie consent transparency**. However, **it does not directly address GDPR requirements for data retention, security, or compliance tracking**.
