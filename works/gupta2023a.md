# Gupta & Hahmann (2023) - OPPO: An Ontology for Describing Fine-Grained Data Practices in Privacy Policies of Online Social Networks

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces **OPPO**, a **privacy ontology for Online Social Networks (OSNs)** that:

- **Models privacy policies and data retention obligations**.  
- **Supports GDPR compliance tracking and transparency auditing**.  
- **Defines security mechanisms and data-sharing practices**.  

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**  
- OPPO **models data retention durations and deletion request mechanisms**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security requirements and encryption**  
- **Includes formalized descriptions of encryption, hashing, and authentication mechanisms**.  

### **CQ51 & CQ52: Data integrity and restoration**  
- **Captures data accountability through structured ontological definitions**.  

### **CQ11 & CQ37: Consent tracking and user rights**  
- **Supports structured representation of consent obligations and privacy transparency**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**  
- **Formalizes third-party data sharing and legal constraints on data transfers**.  

### **CQ57: Data breach documentation**  
- **Models security enforcement mechanisms and compliance requirements for privacy policies**.  


## Key Contributions

✅ **Provides a structured ontology for privacy policy compliance tracking**.  
✅ **Supports GDPR transparency and automated reasoning over privacy obligations**.  
✅ **Includes open-source ontological resources for formalized policy analysis**.  
❌ **Focused primarily on OSNs; may require adaptation for broader GDPR applications**.  
❌ **No direct implementation of real-time compliance enforcement tools**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **privacy ontology research and GDPR compliance automation**, providing **a structured model for transparency evaluation and data governance auditing**.

## **Assessment Against Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**

1. **Proposes a Data Provenance Model to Represent Activities Related to GDPR Obligations** → **Met**
    
    - OPPO **models privacy policies of Online Social Networks (OSNs)** using an ontology-based approach.
        
    - It **captures detailed data practices** related to **data retention, security, and transparency**, making it **applicable for GDPR compliance tracking**.
        
    - The ontology allows **querying and evaluating transparency in privacy policies**, which supports **compliance auditing**.
        
2. **Model Must Be Useful to Address Compliance Questions (CQ08–CQ65)** → **Met**
    
    - Addresses **data retention policies (CQ08, CQ29)** by **modeling storage duration and deletion request mechanisms**.
        
    - Covers **security mechanisms (CQ47, CQ50, CQ51, CQ52)** by defining **encryption, hashing, and authentication methods**.
        
    - Supports **consent and compliance tracking (CQ11, CQ37, CQ38)** with **structured descriptions of data processing obligations**.
        
    - Enables **queries about third-party data sharing (CQ63, CQ64, CQ65)**, allowing organizations to **track and audit data flows**.
        
3. **Model Should Be Publicly Available for Comparison** → **Yes**
    
    - OPPO **is open-source** and available on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/SanondaDattaGupta/OPPO-Ontology/).
        
4. **Document Should Be Written in English or Portuguese** → **Yes**
    
    - The paper is written in **English**.
        
5. **Document Should Be Publicly Accessible or Available in CAPES CAFE Digital Libraries** → **Yes**
    
    - Published in **CEUR-WS (Open Access)**.
        
6. **Should Be a Peer-Reviewed Document (No arXiv Papers)** → **Yes**
    
    - The paper was **peer-reviewed at JOWO 2023**.
        

### **Final Categorization:** `ok`

- **Due:** The paper **proposes OPPO, an ontology that models privacy policies and data practices**, making it relevant for **GDPR compliance tracking and auditing**.
    
- **Primary Strength:** **Structured representation of data retention, security mechanisms, and data-shar**.**ing policies**.
    
- **Applicability:** Useful for **compliance automation, transparency assessment, and legal reasoning over privacy policies**
