### **Final Verdict:** ‚ùå **Unrelated (Does Not Fit Inclusion Criteria)**

The book _Trustworthy Distributed Usage Control Enforcement in Heterogeneous Trusted Computing Environments_ by **Paul Georg Wagner (2025)** does not discuss **data provenance models for GDPR compliance**. It primarily focuses on **distributed usage control enforcement** within **trusted computing environments**, which does not align with the **inclusion criteria**.

This publication **does not align** with the required **GDPR-specific provenance model** and is therefore marked as **unrelated**.
