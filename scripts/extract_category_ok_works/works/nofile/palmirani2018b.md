summary: "\"The GDPR (GDPR, REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND\
  \ OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard\
  \ to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and\
  \ repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)) introduces\
  \ the self-assessment of digital risks and the modulation of duties on the basis\
  \ of the impact assessment analysis, including specific measures that intend to\
  \ safeguard the data subject\u2019s human dignity and fundamental rights. Semantic\
  \ web technologies and legal reasoning tools can support privacy-by-default and\
  \ legal compliance. In this light, this paper presents a first draft of a legal\
  \ ontology on the GDPR, called PrOnto, that has the goal of providing a legal knowledge\
  \ modelling of the privacy agents, data types, types of processing operations, rights\
  \ and obligations. The methodology used here is based on legal theory analysis joined\
  \ with ontological patterns.\""
