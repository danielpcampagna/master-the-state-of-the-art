# Damyanka Tsvyatkova et al. Digital Contact Tracing Applications for COVID-19: A Citizen-Centred Evaluation Framework. Preprint, 2021.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper presents the **Citizen-Focused Compare-and-Contrast Evaluation Framework (C3EF) for digital contact tracing apps (CTAs)**. The framework includes:

- **Evaluation criteria for CTAs covering usability, data protection, transparency, effectiveness, and security**.  
- **Seven key pillars to assess digital contact tracing adoption and compliance**.  
- **A structured assessment methodology applied to existing CTAs**.

While the study provides **valuable insights into data protection and transparency**, it **does not propose a GDPR compliance model or structured data provenance approach**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it evaluates CTAs rather than compliance tracking. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, the study discusses privacy but does not provide a structured compliance approach. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, the evaluation framework is accessible. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes, English. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ❌ No, the document is a preprint and has not undergone peer review. |

## **Final Verdict: NOFILE**

This paper **focuses on evaluating COVID-19 digital contact tracing applications** but **does not propose a GDPR compliance tracking model**. Since it **is not a peer-reviewed document**, it **does not meet the inclusion criteria**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **NOFILE** and should not be included in the dataset.
