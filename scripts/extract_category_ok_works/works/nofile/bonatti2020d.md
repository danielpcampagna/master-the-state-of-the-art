# Piero A. Bonatti, Luca Ioffredo, Iliana M. Petrova, Luigi Sauro. Fast Compliance Checking with General Vocabularies. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.06322, 2020.

## Evaluation Summary

This preprint proposes an approach to **fast compliance checking** using **general vocabularies**. It presents:

- **A compliance checking mechanism** that leverages **general vocabularies** for regulatory reasoning.
- **Algorithmic optimizations** aimed at reducing the complexity of compliance verification.
- **Potential applications in GDPR and data protection compliance frameworks**.

However, since the paper is an **arXiv preprint and not peer-reviewed**, it **does not meet the inclusion criteria**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on compliance checking algorithms. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, does not track obligations like data retention or consent management. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, but lacks peer review. |
| **Written in English?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ❌ No, it is an arXiv preprint. |

## **Final Verdict: NOFILE**

Since this paper has **not been peer-reviewed**, it is categorized as **NOFILE** and does not qualify for inclusion in the dataset.
