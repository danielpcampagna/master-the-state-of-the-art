# Christophe Debruyne, Jonathan Riggio, Olga De Troyer, Declan O’Sullivan. An Ontology for Representing and Annotating Data Flows to Facilitate Compliance Verification. 13th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS 2019), Brussels, Belgium, May 29-31, 2019.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper presents a **semantic ontology** for representing and annotating **data flows**, with a focus on **GDPR compliance verification**. It enables:

- **Automated compliance verification** by linking **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) with structured representations of data**.
- **Tracking and auditing data movements** within systems to ensure **privacy by design and data protection by design**.
- **Integration with existing compliance vocabularies and ontologies**, allowing organizations to **map their data flows to GDPR obligations**.

The ontology is implemented in **OWL 2** and follows **best practices for Semantic Web technologies**, making it a **machine-readable and extensible compliance tool**.

## Relevance to Compliance Questions

| **CQ#** | **Question** | **Relevance** |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **CQ08** | Retention period for personal data? | ✅ The ontology tracks **data retention and movement**. |
| **CQ09** | Ensuring GDPR compliance in processing? | ✅ The model enables **automated compliance verification**. |
| **CQ11** | Re-seeking consent if invalid? | ✅ It facilitates **compliance checks on consent data**. |
| **CQ17** | Responding to Subject Access Requests (SARs)? | ✅ The system maintains **audit logs for compliance**. |
| **CQ20** | Halting processing upon restriction request? | ✅ It supports **automated policy enforcement**. |
| **CQ21** | Informing individuals of their right to object? | ✅ Transparency tools **enhance user awareness**. |
| **CQ25** | Documenting circumstances for data rights restrictions? | ✅ Compliance tracking ensures **policy documentation**. |
| **CQ28** | Ensuring personal data accuracy and updates? | ✅ The ontology allows **verification of data integrity**. |
| **CQ29** | Policies to hold data only as necessary? | ✅ The model provides **automated retention policy enforcement**. |
| **CQ30** | Compliance with mandatory retention periods? | ✅ The ontology aligns **data flows with GDPR retention policies**. |
| **CQ32** | Avoiding unnecessary duplication of records? | ✅ The model ensures **efficient data governance**. |
| **CQ33** | Providing transparent, intelligible privacy policies? | ✅ The ontology enables **structured transparency formats**. |
| **CQ35** | Ensuring up-to-date and accurate personal data? | ✅ The system supports **data verification and correction**. |
| **CQ37** | Proactively informing individuals of GDPR rights? | ✅ The model integrates **privacy rights awareness**. |
| **CQ38** | Making GDPR rights information accessible? | ✅ The ontology enhances **data access transparency**. |
| **CQ39** | Reviewing third-party data agreements? | ✅ The framework supports **third-party compliance tracking**. |
| **CQ40** | Requirement to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ41** | Documenting reasons for not appointing a DPO? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ42** | Defining escalation/reporting lines for a DPO? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ43** | Publishing DPO contact details? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ44** | Notifying data protection authorities of DPO details? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ47** | Documented security programs for personal data? | ✅ The ontology supports **security auditing and tracking**. |
| **CQ48** | Documented process for handling security complaints? | ✅ Compliance logs enable **incident tracking**. |
| **CQ49** | Assigning a security breach investigator? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ50** | Using industry-standard encryption for data transfers? | ✅ The ontology supports **security policies integration**. |
| **CQ51** | Ensuring systematic data deletion when no longer needed? | ✅ Retention policies ensure **timely data disposal**. |
| **CQ52** | Restoring access to personal data after an incident? | ✅ Compliance tracking supports **data recovery verification**. |
| **CQ56** | Regularly reviewing data management plans? | ✅ The ontology enables **continuous compliance monitoring**. |
| **CQ57** | Fully documenting data breaches? | ✅ The model logs **data breach incidents**. |
| **CQ58** | Cooperation in handling data breaches? | ✅ The ontology facilitates **cross-organization compliance**. |
| **CQ63** | Listing and documenting all data transfers? | ✅ Data flows are **fully traceable and documented**. |
| **CQ64** | Ensuring legal bases for international data transfers? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |
| **CQ65** | Informing data subjects about international transfers? | ❌ Not explicitly covered. |

## Justification for Category: OK

- ✅ **Proposes a Data Provenance Model**: The ontology **links data flow tracking with compliance analysis**.  
- ✅ **Addresses GDPR Compliance Questions**: The framework supports **data retention, security, and compliance auditing**.  
- ✅ **Publicly Available Model**: The ontology is **open access** and **licensed under CC-BY-4.0**.  
- ✅ **Written in English**: The document is **fully available in English**.  
- ✅ **Peer-Reviewed**: The paper was presented at **RCIS 2019 (IEEE Conference)**, ensuring **academic validation**.

### **Conclusion**
This paper is **suitable for inclusion** in the dataset as it **proposes a structured compliance model** that directly addresses GDPR-related obligations and regulatory enforcement.
