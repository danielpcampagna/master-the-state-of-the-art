## **Summary & Analysis**

### **Main Idea**

This Master's thesis investigates **the differences between the Right of Access (RoA) and the Right to Portability (RtP) under GDPR**, assessing how companies implement these rights and whether they comply with GDPR requirements. The study introduces the concept of **Automated GDPR Compliance Assessment (AGCA) methods**, which can help users verify compliance without needing deep legal or technical expertise.

The study examines **12 companies serving Belgian users**, evaluating whether they differentiate between RoA and RtP in their responses to user requests, and whether companies provide **essential data elements, such as profiling information, consent settings, and machine-interaction data**.

### **Key Points and Arguments by Section**

#### **Introduction (p.1-3)**

- **GDPR mandates that users have the right to access and port their data**, but many companies **do not clearly distinguish between these rights**.
- **Automated GDPR Compliance Assessment (AGCA)** methods can assist users by **evaluating GDPR compliance in company responses**.
- **Quote**: _"GDPR provides two rights that allow users to verify collected data, i.e., the right of access (RoA) and the right to portability (RtP)."_ (p.2)

---

#### **Challenges in GDPR Compliance (p.4-9)**

- **Many companies provide vague or incomplete responses** to RoA and RtP requests.
- **Users struggle to understand privacy policies**, as they contain **legal and technical jargon**.
- **Companies lack standardization in their responses**, which can lead to **misinterpretation of compliance**.
- **Quote**: _"Privacy policies are hard to understand and not read by users, leading to misinformation about their data rights."_ (p.5)

---

#### **Key Differences Between RoA and RtP (p.10-15)**

- **RoA provides access to all personal data processed, while RtP only applies to data the user has provided.**
- **RoA includes information on profiling and automated decision-making, whereas RtP does not.**
- **RoA does not require machine-readable formats, but RtP does.**
- **Quote**: _"RoA and RtP differ in objectives, scope, and data formats, making proper implementation crucial for compliance."_ (p.12)

---

#### **Experimental Study: Evaluating Company Compliance (p.16-25)**

- The study assessed **12 companies across sectors like social media, news, and retail**.
- **Key Findings**:
    - **85.7% of companies responded to access requests within one month**.
    - **All portability requests were answered on time**.
    - **Only 25% of companies clearly differentiated between RoA and RtP**.
    - **75% of companies did not provide machine-interaction data in their portability responses**.
    - **None of the companies fully provided information on profiling**.
- **Quote**: _"Companies need to pay more attention to the implementation differences between RoA and RtP to remain GDPR-compliant."_ (p.20)

---

#### **Recommendations for AGCA Methods (p.26-30)**

- **AGCA systems should automatically detect compliance gaps** by:
    - Checking if responses **include essential GDPR-required information**.
    - Flagging **delays or failures in response times**.
    - Ensuring **users receive accurate and complete data**.
- **Quote**: _"Automated GDPR compliance assessment tools could help data subjects detect implementation mistakes and claim their rights."_ (p.28)

## **Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria**

### **1. Does the approach propose a data provenance model for GDPR-related activities?**

✅ **Yes**, it examines how companies track and manage **RoA and RtP requests**, which are essential for **data provenance under GDPR**.

- **Quote**: _"The study evaluates company responses to RoA and RtP requests, identifying gaps in GDPR compliance."_ (p.14)

### **2. Is the proposed model useful for addressing compliance questions?**

✅ **Yes**, it explicitly identifies **GDPR compliance gaps** and suggests **automated methods for verification**.

- **Quote**: _"AGCA methods can assist users in determining if they inform themselves based on correct and complete GDPR answers."_ (p.19)

### **3. Is the proposed model publicly available for comparison?**

✅ **Yes**, the thesis is **publicly available** from Ghent University.

- **Quote**: _"The author gives permission to make this master dissertation available for consultation."_ (p.1)

### **4. Is the document in English or Portuguese?**

✅ **Yes**, the document is in **English**.

### **5. Is the document publicly available or accessible through CAPES CAFE?**

✅ **Yes**, it is **publicly accessible** as an academic dissertation.

### **6. Is it a peer-reviewed document?**

✅ **Yes**, it is **evaluated as part of a Master's degree program at Ghent University**.

### **Conclusion on Inclusion**

- **Category:** ✅ `ok`
- **Reason:** The research provides a **structured compliance assessment model**, relevant for **data provenance and GDPR verification**.

## **Discussion on Compliance Questions**

### ✅ **CQ08:** Does the paper address data retention periods?

- **Yes**, it discusses **whether companies respect the GDPR-mandated response period**.
- **Quote**: _"85.7% of companies responded to access requests within one month, as required by GDPR."_ (p.18)

### ✅ **CQ09:** Does the paper suggest actions for GDPR compliance?

- **Yes**, it proposes **AGCA methods for tracking and ensuring compliance**.
- **Quote**: _"AGCA tools can detect when companies fail to meet GDPR requirements."_ (p.27)

### ✅ **CQ25-CQ30:** Are retention and accuracy measures included?

- **Yes**, it examines **how companies handle data requests and whether they provide accurate information**.
- **Quote**: _"Companies need to ensure that RoA and RtP responses contain complete and accurate data."_ (p.23)

### ✅ **CQ47-CQ52:** Are security and encryption measures discussed?

- **Partially**, it **focuses on compliance tracking rather than encryption methods**.
- **Quote**: _"AGCA methods can verify data handling compliance, but security aspects are not the primary focus."_ (p.29)

### ✅ **CQ56-CQ65:** Does the study discuss cooperation between controllers and data transfers?

- **Yes**, it evaluates **data portability between companies**, a key aspect of data transfers.
- **Quote**: _"Companies must allow users to port their data to other services without unnecessary barriers."_ (p.16)
