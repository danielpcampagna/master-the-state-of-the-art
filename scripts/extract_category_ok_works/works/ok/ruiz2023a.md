# Alejandra Ruiz, Yod-Samuel Martin, Jabier Martinez, Jacobo Quintans, Guillaume Mockly, Amelie Gyrard, Tommaso Crepax. Modeling ecosystems of reference frameworks for assurance: a case on privacy impact assessment regulation and guidelines. Software and Systems Modeling, 2023.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper introduces a **reference framework modeling approach** to bridge the gap between **legal GDPR requirements** and **engineering privacy impact assessment (PIA) methodologies**. It specifically focuses on:

- **Modeling GDPR DPIA legal requirements** and mapping them to **ISO/IEC 29134 & EU Smart Grid DPIA template**.
- **Using OpenCert for technical support**, ensuring **systematic compliance tracking**.
- **Facilitating GDPR legal-technical alignment**, enhancing transparency for engineers and policymakers.

## Relevance to Compliance Questions
