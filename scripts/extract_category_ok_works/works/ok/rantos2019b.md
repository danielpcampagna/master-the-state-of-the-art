# Rantos et al. (2019) - A Blockchain-Based Platform for Consent Management of Personal Data Processing in the IoT Ecosystem

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces **ADVOCATE**, a **blockchain-based consent management platform** that:

- **Tracks and verifies user consents** for personal data processing.  
- **Uses smart contracts and digital signatures** to ensure **GDPR compliance**.  
- **Provides immutable, verifiable logs of consent history**, ensuring **auditability and security**.  

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The system **records and tracks data retention periods**, ensuring **compliance with GDPR storage limitations**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security requirements and encryption**
- **Hyperledger Fabric ensures cryptographic security** and **role-based access control**.  

### **CQ51 & CQ52: Data integrity, anonymization, and restoration**
- **Immutable blockchain records protect consent integrity**, preventing **unauthorized modifications**.  

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about GDPR rights**
- The system provides **clear, user-friendly consent notifications** and **withdrawal options**.  

### **CQ57: Data breach documentation**
- **Blockchain logs all consent-related transactions**, supporting **forensic investigations and audits**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Provides a blockchain-based GDPR compliance model**.  
✅ **Ensures immutable, verifiable consent tracking**.  
✅ **Supports transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance**.  
❌ **No open-source implementation available**.  
❌ **Focuses primarily on IoT; may require adaptation for broader GDPR use cases**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **blockchain-based GDPR compliance solutions**, providing **provenance tracking, consent verification, and data integrity mechanisms**. **ADVOCATE enhances transparency and accountability** in personal data processing.
