# Meroño-Peñuela et al. (2025) - KG.GOV: Knowledge Graphs as the Backbone of Data Governance in AI

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces **KG.GOV**, a **knowledge graph-based framework** designed to enhance **data governance in AI**. The framework:

- **Uses knowledge graphs (KGs) to model data, manage representations, and describe behavior**.  
- **Ensures data lineage, interoperability, and accountability for AI systems**.  
- **Documents metadata and provenance for AI-generated content**.  

However, it **does not specifically address GDPR compliance**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about AI governance**  
- The framework **promotes transparency in AI workflows and data management**.  

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and provenance tracking**  
- KG.GOV **enables tracking of data provenance and lineage**, but **does not enforce GDPR retention policies**.  

### **CQ51: Data accountability and security**  
- The framework **uses metadata to document AI data governance**, but **lacks specific mechanisms for GDPR compliance**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ11: Consent tracking**  
- The framework **does not support consent enforcement or GDPR-compliant data access policies**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security and encryption**  
- While it ensures **data provenance**, it **does not enforce encryption or access control** for GDPR compliance.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**  
- The framework **does not include mechanisms for tracking cross-border data transfers**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Proposes a knowledge graph-based model for AI data governance**.  
✅ **Ensures data lineage and accountability in AI workflows**.  
✅ **Supports interoperability and transparency**.  
❌ **Not designed for GDPR-specific compliance tracking**.  
❌ **No enforcement mechanisms for personal data protection obligations**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **AI data governance using knowledge graphs**, focusing on **transparency and accountability**. However, **it does not directly address GDPR requirements for data retention, deletion, or security enforcement**.
