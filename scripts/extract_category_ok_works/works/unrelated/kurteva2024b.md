# Kurteva et al. (2024) - Semantic Web and its Role in Facilitating ICT Data Sharing for the Circular Economy: An Ontology Survey

## Approach and Motivations

The paper provides a **comprehensive survey of ontologies** used in **ICT data sharing** for the **circular economy (CE)**. The study:

- **Explores FAIR data principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).  
- **Analyzes existing ontologies for ICT, materials, and CE applications**.  
- **Discusses data transparency and interoperability challenges**.  

However, **GDPR compliance is not the primary focus**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about ICT data governance**  
- The study **evaluates how ontologies improve data sharing and transparency**.  

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and provenance tracking**  
- **Describes how semantic models help document ICT lifecycle and provenance**.  

### **CQ51: Data integrity and security**  
- The surveyed ontologies **support structured data documentation**, but **do not enforce GDPR security policies**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ11: Consent tracking**  
- **The study does not provide models for consent enforcement or GDPR legal tracking**.  

### **CQ47 & CQ50: Security and encryption**  
- **No mechanisms for encryption, access control, or GDPR data protection**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**  
- The paper **focuses on interoperability, not legal compliance** for cross-border data transfers.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Comprehensive review of ontologies for ICT data sharing**.  
✅ **Promotes data transparency and interoperability**.  
✅ **Addresses sustainability and data management issues**.  
❌ **Not designed for GDPR compliance or personal data tracking**.  
❌ **No enforcement mechanisms for GDPR obligations**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **semantic data governance for the circular economy**, focusing on **FAIR principles and ICT interoperability**. However, **it does not directly address GDPR requirements for data retention, security, or compliance tracking**.
