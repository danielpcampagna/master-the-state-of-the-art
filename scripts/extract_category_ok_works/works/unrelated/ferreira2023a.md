## Evaluation Summary

This paper presents a **survey on the use of Recommender Systems (RS) in Cybersecurity**. The contributions include:

- **Reviewing RS techniques (collaborative filtering, knowledge-based, hybrid models) in Cybersecurity applications**.
- **Examining how RS can assist Security Information Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) systems**.
- **Highlighting potential RS applications in privacy-aware Cybersecurity frameworks**.

While the paper provides **valuable insights into RS applications**, it **does not propose a GDPR compliance model or data provenance approach**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it surveys RS in Cybersecurity, not compliance tracking. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, GDPR is mentioned as a challenge, but no compliance solution is proposed. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ❌ No, the paper presents a survey, not an implementable model. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ✅ Yes, published in a peer-reviewed journal. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This paper **surveys Recommender Systems in Cybersecurity** but **does not propose a GDPR compliance model or data tracking framework**. While it contributes to **understanding RS applications in security**, it **does not align with GDPR compliance obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
