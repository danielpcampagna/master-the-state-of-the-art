# Sim, Junsik et al. *Technical Requirements and Approaches in Personal Data Control.* 2022.

## Approach and Motivations

This paper is a **literature survey** that examines **technical approaches for personal data control** in response to various **privacy regulations** (GDPR, CCPA, PIPA, APPI). The study identifies key **compliance verification techniques** and discusses **traceability requirements**.

Key contributions include:
- **Survey of data control mechanisms** across different jurisdictions.  
- **Identification of GDPR technical requirements**, such as consent management and traceability.  
- **Evaluation of existing compliance mechanisms** for data subject rights enforcement.  
- **Discussion on future research challenges in personal data sovereignty**.

Despite these contributions, the paper **does not propose a formal data provenance model**, which is a core requirement for inclusion.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

Although the **survey identifies GDPR compliance challenges**, it does not present a **systematic provenance tracking framework**. Some compliance aspects are addressed:

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- The paper outlines **data control obligations** under GDPR.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Discusses **technical transparency mechanisms**.

### **CQ47 - Security Program Documentation**
- Identifies **traceability as a compliance requirement**.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 - Data Retention Periods**
- No formal **data retention tracking model**.

### **CQ29 - Retention Policies**
- Lacks a **structured policy enforcement mechanism**.

### **CQ51 - Data Erasure and Anonymization**
- Does **not propose systematic data erasure protocols**.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- **No tracking mechanism** for international **data transfers**.

### **CQ64 - Legal Basis for Data Transfers**
- The survey discusses **legal frameworks** but does **not track compliance actions**.

## Key Contributions

- **Literature Review:** Provides a **comprehensive analysis** of **data control approaches**.  
- **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluates **GDPR and other global privacy regulations**.  
- **Future Directions:** Highlights **open research gaps** in **data accountability**.  

## State-of-the-Art

While this study enhances **privacy research**, it lacks **data lineage tracking**. Unlike **data provenance models**, this work **focuses on compliance gaps rather than implementation frameworks**.

## Conclusion

This paper **provides a survey of GDPR-related data control mechanisms**, but it **does not propose a structured data provenance model** for GDPR compliance. Therefore, it is **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.
