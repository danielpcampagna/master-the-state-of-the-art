# Maranhão et al. (2022) - Normative Change: An AGM Approach

## Approach and Motivations

The paper introduces a **logical model for normative change** using the **AGM (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson) belief revision framework**. The approach:

- Analyzes **validity and change of legal rules** in normative systems.  
- Explores **deontic logic and input/output logic** for modeling **legal reasoning**.  
- Focuses on **interpretation, revision, and adaptation of legal rules**.  

However, it **does not propose a GDPR data provenance model** and **does not track personal data processing**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about regulations**
- The model **examines how legal rules change over time**, contributing to **understanding regulatory evolution**.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The paper **does not address data retention tracking** or **deletion enforcement**.

### **CQ20 & CQ25: Halting processing and restricting data use**
- The model **focuses on legal reasoning**, **not on personal data restrictions**.

### **CQ51: Data anonymization and destruction**
- It **does not propose mechanisms** for **data anonymization or systematic deletion**.

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- The paper **does not document personal data transfers** or **GDPR compliance justifications**.

## Key Contributions

✅ Provides **a formal model for normative change**.  
✅ Explores **AGM belief revision theory in legal reasoning**.  
✅ Analyzes **legal interpretation and rule adaptation**.  
❌ **Does not propose a GDPR data provenance model**.  
❌ **Lacks mechanisms for tracking GDPR compliance activities**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to the **field of legal reasoning and normative change**, but **is not applicable to GDPR data tracking**. While useful for **understanding legal rule evolution**, it **does not meet GDPR compliance requirements**.
