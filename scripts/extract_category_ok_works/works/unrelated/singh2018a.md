summary: 'This approach aims to introduce Decision Provenance as a means to reach
  accountability in a highly interconnected context. It starts from the GDPR issues;
  but, from this concept, argues how it meets those ones.


  By tieing accountability, from a legal point of view, to notions of responsibility,
  liability, and transparency (and transparency not necessarily meaning full transparency
  over the internal functions of a system, but information about the entities involved,
  the risks of using those systems and high-level information about what is happening
  with data or about what systems are doing), the authors point out the controllers/processors
  obligations to proactively, and by design and by default (Art. 12 and 25, Rec. 59
  and 78), be able to demonstrate compliance with its various requirements, including
  the data processing principles (Art. 5), the data subject rights (especially Art.
  17 and Art. 21, which follows that transparency over data; for example, data inventories
  that record where data came from, the subjects that it refers to, and where it goes
  to) also they are responsible for the accountability aspects in automated decision-making.


  From the above, given (i) the concerns around accountability for automated and algorithmic
  decision-making systems, (ii) the increasingly interconnected nature of system deployments,
  and (iii) the potential of provenance methods in this space, we propose decision
  provenance as a way forward; this approach introduces the decision provenance, which
  involves providing the information on the nature and contexts of the data flows
  and interconnections leading up to a decision or action, the flow-on effects, and
  also how such information can be leveraged for better system design,

  inspection, validation and operational (run-time) behaviour.


  Further, the paper presents through many examples how this approach should be useful
  to ensure accountability in this context, and indicates some areas for implementing
  mechanisms (i.e., recording, management) and making data provenance meaningful for
  enabling its interpretation. But, in general, the approach is too vague and do not
  present a practical solution. Instead, this approach open issues for new discussions
  about the introduced concept.'
