## **Summary & Analysis**

### **Main Idea**

The paper presents **deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for predicting the next transaction in anonymized payment datasets**. The study focuses on **privacy-preserving machine learning**, ensuring **GDPR and LGPD compliance** by avoiding the use of **personally identifiable information (PII)**. The **Online Retail Dataset** is used for evaluation, demonstrating that **GRU outperforms other models in generalization**.
