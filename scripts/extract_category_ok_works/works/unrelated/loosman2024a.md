# Loosman, Iris. *Rethinking Informed Consent in mHealth.* 2024.

## Approach and Motivations

The dissertation explores the **role of informed consent** in **mobile health (mHealth)** applications. It critically evaluates **existing consent models**, challenges of **decision-making engagement**, and proposes an alternative approach based on **relational and temporal autonomy**.

Key contributions include:
- A critical **analysis of informed consent** in digital health applications.
- Examination of **alternative consent models** (e.g., broad consent, dynamic consent).
- Consideration of **empowerment and engagement** in user decision-making.
- Ethical discussion on **autonomy and informed consent gaps**.

While the dissertation presents valuable insights into **consent challenges**, it **does not propose a data provenance model**, which is a strict requirement for inclusion.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

The dissertation discusses **regulatory aspects** of **consent practices** but lacks a direct application to GDPR compliance questions. Below is its **potential relevance** to compliance aspects:

### **CQ11 - Consent Validity**
- Discusses **alternative consent frameworks** that could impact **consent validity** under GDPR.

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- Emphasizes **user engagement and autonomy** in decision-making.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Explores the **lack of transparency in current consent models**, highlighting issues with **user awareness**.

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 - Data Retention Periods**
- Does not address **data retention policies** or define **retention duration** for GDPR compliance.

### **CQ29 - Retention Policies**
- No mention of **structured retention policies**.

### **CQ51 - Data Erasure and Anonymization**
- Fails to discuss **systematic deletion or anonymization** of personal data.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- No methodology for **tracking data transfers**.

### **CQ64 - Legal Basis for Data Transfers**
- Does not store or document **legal justifications for data processing**.

## Key Contributions

- **Conceptual Framework:** Proposes a **rethinking of consent models** in **mHealth**.
- **Empowerment & Engagement:** Examines how **users can be involved in decision-making**.
- **Regulatory Challenges:** Discusses **issues with informed consent compliance** in digital health.

## State-of-the-Art

The dissertation contributes to **consent model research** but does not introduce **data lineage tracking**. Unlike works that model **data accountability**, this research focuses on **user engagement in decision-making**.

## Conclusion

While this dissertation presents **insightful discussions** on **consent models**, it **does not** introduce a **data provenance model** or compliance framework. Therefore, it is **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.
