due: This paper introduces an ontology for the South African POPIA, which is similar to GDPR but not explicitly designed for GDPR compliance. While it categorizes privacy obligations and personal data regulations, it does not provide a full data provenance model for GDPR.

# Jafta (2023) - An Ontology on the Imminent POPI Act

## Approach and Motivations

The paper presents an **ontology-based approach** to **model South Africa’s Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA)**. The ontology:

- **Defines key legal roles and responsibilities** (e.g., data subject, data controller).  
- **Models personal data processing obligations** under POPIA.  
- **Provides a semantic structure for compliance tracking**.  

However, it **does not provide a complete GDPR compliance framework**.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

### **CQ37 & CQ38: Informing individuals about regulations**
- The ontology helps define **roles and obligations for data controllers and data subjects**.  

### **CQ51 & CQ52: Data accountability and security**
- Models **legal responsibilities in data handling**, but **not retention or deletion policies**.  

## Approach Insufficiencies For Fulfilling The Compliance Questions

### **CQ08 & CQ29: Data retention and deletion policies**
- The ontology **does not specify data retention limits or deletion requirements**.  

### **CQ63 & CQ64: Data transfers and legal basis**
- The paper **does not document international data transfers** or **GDPR legal bases**.  

## Key Contributions

✅ **Provides a structured ontology for data protection laws (POPIA)**.  
✅ **Helps clarify compliance roles and responsibilities**.  
✅ **Defines legal processing obligations for personal data**.  
❌ **Not designed for GDPR-specific compliance tracking**.  
❌ **No publicly available implementation**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This work contributes to **legal compliance ontologies**, but **does not provide a GDPR-specific framework**. While **POPIA aligns with GDPR**, the ontology is **not structured for GDPR compliance tracking or data provenance models**.
