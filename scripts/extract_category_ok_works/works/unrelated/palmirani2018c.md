due: "This paper introduces a privacy ontology to represent and model concepts of the GDPR. This ontology is presented in a few modules which aim to represent specific topics of the law, namely: (1) Data and Document, (2) Agent and Role, (3) Purposes and Legal Basis, (4) Data Processing, (5) Deontic Operators, (6) Rights and Obligations relationships, (7) Duties and Violation. This ontology evaluation is presented in running European H2020 Projects. Although some of these modules can assist in the objective of our research, this paper does not make publicly available this ontology."
