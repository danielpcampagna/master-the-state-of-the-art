# Aslanova, Tamara. *The Role and Importance of Consent Management in Public Organizations in the Digital Age: Case on Estonia.* 2021.

## Status: Unrelated

### **Summary**
This thesis analyzes the **importance of consent management** in the public sector, particularly in the Estonian **e-Governance** context. It highlights the significance of **informed consent**, **accountability**, and **autonomy** under **GDPR regulations**. However, it does not propose a **formal data provenance model** or a structured GDPR **compliance framework**.

### **Reasons for Exclusion**
- **Lacks a structured provenance model** for GDPR-related activities.
- **Focuses on consent management principles** rather than data provenance.
- **Does not propose an openly available model** for comparison.
- **Not peer-reviewed**, as it is a Masterâ€™s thesis.
- **Public access is uncertain** (not confirmed as available through CAPES CAFE).
