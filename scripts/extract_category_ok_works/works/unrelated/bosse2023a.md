# Christian K. Bosse, Denis Feth, Hartmut Schmitt. Challenges, Conflicts, and Solution Strategies for the Introduction of Corporate Data Protection Measures. In: Human Factors in Privacy Research. Springer, 2023.

## Evaluation Summary

This chapter examines the **socio-technical challenges of corporate data protection**. It highlights the interplay between **technical, organizational, and social spheres** in data privacy but **does not introduce a structured data provenance model**.

Key themes include:

- **Data protection conflicts in the corporate environment**
- **Employee privacy and organizational data governance**
- **Challenges in implementing privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)**
- **Strategies for balancing corporate and employee privacy rights**

While GDPR topics are addressed, the **focus is on corporate strategy and privacy conflicts, not data provenance or compliance tracking**.

## Justification for Category: Unrelated

- ❌ **No Data Provenance Model**: The chapter **does not introduce a framework** for tracking **data lineage, processing activities, or retention policies**.
- ❌ **Not Directly Related to GDPR Compliance Questions**: It explores **corporate privacy governance**, but **not structured GDPR compliance tracking**.
- ✅ **Peer-Reviewed**: As part of an **edited volume**, the chapter is **peer-reviewed**.
- ✅ **Publicly Available**: The book is **open access** under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License**.
- ✅ **Written in English**.

### **Conclusion**
This chapter is **not suitable for inclusion** in the dataset as it **does not propose a data provenance model** that can be used to address GDPR obligations and compliance questions.
