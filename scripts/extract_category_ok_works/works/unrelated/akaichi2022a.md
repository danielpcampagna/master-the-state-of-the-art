# Akaichi, Ines & Kirrane, Sabrina. *Usage Control Specification, Enforcement, and Robustness: A Survey.* 2022.

## Approach and Motivations

This paper surveys **policy-based enforcement mechanisms** for **usage control**, focusing on **specification, enforcement, and robustness**. It **categorizes and evaluates** various frameworks used for **controlling access and enforcing policies** in decentralized environments.

Key contributions include:
- **Systematic review of policy-based enforcement mechanisms** for **data governance**.  
- **Comparative analysis** of **policy languages and enforcement strategies**.  
- **Taxonomy of usage control requirements**, including **preventive and detective mechanisms**.  

Despite these contributions, **no structured GDPR data provenance model is proposed**, making it **unrelated** to the research scope.

## Approach Contribution For The Compliance Questions

The **policy enforcement focus** supports GDPR-related discussions but **does not track data lineage or retention policies**:

### **CQ21 - Informing Data Subjects of Rights**
- Discusses **policy transparency** to ensure individuals understand how data is controlled.

### **CQ33 - Transparent Data Use**
- Identifies policy **enforcement strategies** to improve **data accountability**.

### **CQ47 - Security Program Documentation**
- Evaluates **policy-based control models** relevant to **GDPR enforcement**.

### **CQ63 - Listing Data Transfers**
- Reviews **mechanisms for managing data flow policies**.

## Approach Insufficiencies

The study **does not address**:
- **Data retention policies (CQ08, CQ29)**.  
- **Automated erasure and anonymization (CQ51)**.  
- **Implementation of a structured data provenance framework**.  

## Key Contributions

- **Survey of policy-based enforcement models** for decentralized data usage.  
- **Analysis of semantic policy languages** for compliance tracking.  
- **Comparative evaluation of frameworks for security and robustness**.  

## State-of-the-Art

This paper **analyzes enforcement frameworks** but **does not introduce a GDPR-focused data tracking model**. It is **relevant for understanding policy control mechanisms** but **not for data provenance tracking**.

## Conclusion

The paper **focuses on access control and policy enforcement** rather than **GDPR data tracking**. It does **not introduce a compliance model**, making it **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.
