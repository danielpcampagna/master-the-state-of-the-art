# Jan Willemson. Analysis of Information Security Measures Embedded in the GDPR, 2023.

## Evaluation Summary

This paper provides an **analysis of information security measures mandated by GDPR**, categorized into:

- **Prevention measures (e.g., data protection by design, encryption, pseudonymization)**.
- **Detection mechanisms (e.g., record-keeping, monitoring, breach notifications)**.
- **Response actions (e.g., reporting requirements, legal actions)**.
- **Recovery gaps (lack of GDPR mandates on breach recovery methods)**.

While the paper offers a **valuable breakdown of security mechanisms**, it **does not propose a structured compliance model or data provenance framework**.

### **Why It Does Not Meet Inclusion Criteria**

| **Criteria** | **Evaluation** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Proposes a GDPR data provenance model?** | ❌ No, it focuses on security analysis. |
| **Addresses GDPR compliance tracking?** | ❌ No, it does not provide compliance verification mechanisms. |
| **Publicly available model?** | ✅ Yes, GDPR security categorization is available in the paper. |
| **Written in English or Portuguese?** | ✅ Yes. |
| **Peer-reviewed?** | ✅ Yes, presented in a peer-reviewed venue. |

## **Final Verdict: UNRELATED**

This paper **analyzes GDPR security mechanisms** but **does not propose a GDPR compliance model or data provenance tracking framework**. While it contributes to **understanding GDPR security provisions**, it **does not align with compliance tracking obligations**.

Thus, this work is categorized as **UNRELATED** and should not be included in the dataset.
