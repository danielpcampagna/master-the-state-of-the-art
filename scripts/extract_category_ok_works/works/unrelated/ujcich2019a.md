summary: 'The work is concerned with the personal-data-transfer aspect included in
  the definition of processing by the GDPR. Its solution is a framework for an intent-based
  network (IBN) that is focused on four goals: (1) Specify host-to-host data plane
  connection requests for data processing through data protection abstractions; (2)
  Maintain observance and oversight over all network requests that involve personal
  data; (3) Log control plane and data plane events to bridge network abstractions
  and data protection abstractions; (4) Use data protection abstractions to query
  past events for analysis and forensics.'
