# **Summary & Analysis**

## **Summary**

The paper **"Barriers to Implementing ML for Cybercrime Prevention in Online Retailing"** by **Kamran Razzaq and Mahmood Shah (2024)** investigates the **challenges and barriers that online retailers face when implementing machine learning (ML) for cybersecurity**. The study **conducts semi-structured interviews with cybersecurity experts** to explore technical, organizational, and regulatory challenges in deploying ML-based cybercrime prevention strategies.

### **Key Contributions**

1. **Identification of Key Barriers to ML Adoption in Cybersecurity**
    
    - **Technical barriers**: **Data quality, adversarial ML attacks, model scalability issues.**
    - **Organizational barriers**: **High implementation costs, lack of skilled ML professionals, resistance to change.**
    - **Regulatory barriers**: **Privacy concerns, data protection compliance issues, legal uncertainties.**
2. **Qualitative Analysis of Cybersecurity Experts' Perspectives**
    
    - Conducted **41 semi-structured interviews** with professionals from online retail security teams.
    - Used **NVivo 14.0 for qualitative data analysis** to extract major themes.
3. **Regulatory Compliance Challenges for ML in Online Retailing**
    
    - **Privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)** create difficulties in collecting and using consumer data for ML training.
    - **Biases in ML decision-making raise ethical concerns in fraud detection.**
    - **Data security concerns, including regulatory obligations for protecting ML models from manipulation.**

### **Key Findings**

- **ML adoption for cybercrime prevention is hindered by insufficient high-quality labeled data.**
- **ML models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, requiring constant updates.**
- **Retailers face legal risks when using customer data for fraud detection.**
- **Regulatory compliance costs discourage small businesses from investing in ML-based cybersecurity.**

### **Key Quotes**

- _‚ÄúMachine learning has the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity, but its implementation in online retailing is fraught with technical, financial, and regulatory challenges.‚Äù_ (Page 1)
- _‚ÄúData privacy regulations such as GDPR limit the availability of training data, making it harder for ML models to detect cyber threats effectively.‚Äù_ (Page 4)
- _‚ÄúAdversarial attacks against ML-based fraud detection systems pose a significant security risk, requiring constant retraining of models.‚Äù_ (Page 6)

# **Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria**

1. **Does the paper propose a data provenance model for GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ‚ùå **No.** The study examines **regulatory barriers to ML adoption** but **does not introduce a data provenance model for tracking GDPR obligations**.
    - **Quote (Page 5):** _‚ÄúPrivacy laws restrict access to consumer data, complicating the use of ML for fraud detection.‚Äù_
2. **Does the proposed model address compliance questions related to GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ‚ùå **Partially.** The paper discusses **privacy and regulatory challenges** for ML adoption but **does not provide structured compliance tracking**.
    - **Quote (Page 6):** _‚ÄúGDPR compliance requirements pose legal challenges in using customer data for machine learning cybersecurity models.‚Äù_
3. **Is the proposed model publicly available?**
    
    - ‚ùå **No.** The study **identifies challenges but does not offer a publicly available compliance framework**.
4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** The paper is in **English**.
5. **Is the document publicly available?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** Published in **AIS Electronic Library (AISeL)**, which provides open access.
6. **Is the document peer-reviewed?**
    
    - ‚úÖ **Yes.** Presented at **SaudiCIS 2024**, a **peer-reviewed conference**.

### **Final Verdict:** üî¥ **Category: "Unrelated"**

The paper **analyzes cybersecurity challenges in ML adoption** but **does not propose a GDPR data provenance model**, making it **unrelated** to the inclusion criteria.

# **Discussion on Compliance Questions**

The **study identifies privacy and regulatory barriers** but **does not directly address GDPR compliance questions (CQs)**.

|**Compliance Question**|**Addressed?**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|---|
|**CQ08 (Retention Periods)**|‚ùå|No mention of **data retention policies**.|
|**CQ09 (Ensuring Compliance Actions)**|‚ùå|**Analyzes barriers but does not provide compliance solutions.**|
|**CQ11 (Consent Management)**|‚ùå|**No discussion on consent tracking.**|
|**CQ29 (Retention Policies & Procedures)**|‚ùå|**Only discusses privacy barriers, not retention procedures.**|

### **Conclusion**

The study **highlights compliance barriers** but **does not provide a structured GDPR tracking model**.
