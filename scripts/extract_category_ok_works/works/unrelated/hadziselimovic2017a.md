due: This approach extends prior ontologies that represent permission and prohibition
  relationships between agents to make it possible to represent the rights as the
  GDPR establishes. Although this produces an ontology, it is not relating to the
  provenance of the activities. In the conclusion section, the authors affirm they
  intend to integrate the approach with provenance; however, until this review, nothing
  was published. Additionally, the ontology was not made publicly available in this
  document.
