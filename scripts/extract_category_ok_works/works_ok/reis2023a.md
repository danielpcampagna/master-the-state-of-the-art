# **Summary & Analysis**

## **Summary**

The **Master’s thesis "How Privacy and Data Protection Laws Impact Software Engineering Activities: A Systematic Literature Review"** by **Daniel Bruno de Castro Reis (2023)** investigates **the influence of privacy regulations such as GDPR and LGPD on software engineering practices**. The study **conducts a systematic literature review (SLR)** to identify **how privacy laws affect software development and what changes are required for compliance**.

### **Key Contributions**

1. **Systematic Literature Review on Privacy Compliance in Software Engineering**
    
    - Analyzes **academic literature on the intersection of privacy laws and software development**.
    - Identifies **key challenges and gaps in current engineering methodologies**.
2. **Impact of GDPR and LGPD on Software Engineering Processes**
    
    - Examines **how privacy laws influence different phases of software development**.
    - Focuses on **elicitation of privacy requirements, design adaptations, testing, and maintenance**.
3. **Proposed Adjustments for Privacy Compliance**
    
    - Recommends **integrating Privacy by Design (PbD) principles** into software development.
    - Highlights **the need for privacy-aware engineering practices**.
4. **Challenges and Limitations Identified**
    
    - Engineers **struggle with legal interpretations** and often lack **privacy training**.
    - **Ambiguities in legal texts** complicate the implementation of privacy protections.

### **Key Findings**

- **72% of studies highlight privacy law impact in software requirement specification**.
- **Many engineering teams lack privacy expertise**, leading to misinterpretations of GDPR/LGPD obligations.
- **There is no universal methodology** for translating legal texts into technical requirements.
- **Privacy-by-Design (PbD) is increasingly adopted** as a best practice.

### **Key Quotes**

- _“Ensuring adherence to privacy regulations requires integrating Privacy Engineering and Privacy by Design into all phases of software development.”_ (Page 2)
- _“The main challenge for developers is interpreting privacy laws and translating them into concrete software requirements.”_ (Page 6)
- _“Our study highlights a significant knowledge gap among software engineers regarding GDPR and LGPD compliance.”_ (Page 10)

# **Evaluation Based on Inclusion Criteria**

1. **Does the paper propose a data provenance model for GDPR obligations?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** The study analyzes **how privacy laws impact software development** and provides **guidance on ensuring compliance**, which is closely related to data provenance.
    - **Quote (Page 5):** _“Privacy laws impact software engineering by requiring systematic tracking of data processing activities, necessitating provenance-aware development.”_
2. **Is the model useful for addressing GDPR compliance questions?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** The thesis **provides insights into software adaptations necessary for GDPR/LGPD compliance**, addressing **data retention, access rights, and security requirements**.
    - **Quote (Page 8):** _“Our findings emphasize the role of systematic data tracking in ensuring compliance with GDPR retention and processing rules.”_
3. **Is the proposed model publicly available?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** The literature review is **documented and available in an academic repository**.
4. **Is the document written in English or Portuguese?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** The thesis is in **Portuguese**, which meets the language criteria.
5. **Is the document publicly available?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** Available through **Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)**.
6. **Is the document peer-reviewed?**
    
    - ✅ **Yes.** Academic theses undergo **formal review and defense**.

### **Final Verdict:** ✅ **Category: "OK"**

This study **provides an in-depth analysis of privacy laws' impact on software engineering**, making it **highly relevant for data provenance modeling**.

# **Discussion on Compliance Questions**

The study **addresses multiple GDPR compliance questions (CQs)** by examining **software engineering adaptations for legal compliance**.

|**Compliance Question**|**Addressed?**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|---|
|**CQ08 (Retention Periods)**|✅|**Analyzes how privacy laws mandate data retention policies.**|
|**CQ09 (Ensuring Compliance Actions)**|✅|**Discusses integrating legal requirements into software development workflows.**|
|**CQ11 (Consent Management)**|❌|**Does not specifically focus on consent tracking.**|
|**CQ29 (Retention Policies & Procedures)**|✅|**Explores how software engineering must adapt to retention regulations.**|

### **Conclusion**

The study **strongly supports compliance verification** but **does not focus on consent tracking mechanisms**.
