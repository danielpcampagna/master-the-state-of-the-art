## **Summary & Analysis**

### **Main Idea**

The document _D4.3: Distributed Privacy and Policy Layer: Approach and Implementation_ is a **technical report from the SPICE H2020 project**, focusing on **privacy, policy management, and compliance with GDPR in citizen-curated cultural heritage data**. It introduces the **SPICE Linked Data Hub (LDH)**, a platform designed to enable **fine-grained access control, policy enforcement, and privacy monitoring** for user-contributed data in museum archives. The system **detects Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and enforces data privacy rules** to help institutions comply with GDPR.
