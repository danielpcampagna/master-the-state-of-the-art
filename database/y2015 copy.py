    summary="Data protection, currently under the limelight at the European level, is undergoing a long and complex reform that is finally approaching its completion. Consequently, there is an urgent need to customize semantic standards towards the prospective legal framework. The aim of this paper is to provide a bottom-up ontology describing the constituents of data protection domain and its relationships. Our contribution envisions a methodology to highlight the (new) duties of data controllers and foster the transition of IT-based systems, services, tools and businesses to comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation. This structure may serve as the foundation for the design of data protection compliant information systems.",

#     summary="Knowledge theory has made its way into modern computing, through the use of models and annotations to organize it. The bottom layer of knowledge organizations makes use of ontologies, which are models based on a formal language structure and designed to express the concepts pertaining to a domain and the relationships between them. The use of ontologies is popular also in the legal domain to organize legal documents and as a support to legal reasoning. A legal topic which is currently under the limelight at the European level is data protection. Under the pressure of the last yearsâ€™ technological developments, the data protection legislation has shown its weaknesses, and is currently undergoing a long and complex reform that is finally approaching its completion. The reform will urge businesses dealing with personal data to comply with the new Regulation. The aim of the current paper is to provide a basic ontology for the upcoming data protection legislation, highlighting the duties of the data controller, to ease the transition of systems and services from the existing legislation to the new one.",
